"A new study has been carried to test the role of story telling in lowering blood pressure. Dr. Thomas Houston, a professor of the University of Massachusetts Medical School, led a group of scientists that investigated how pre-recorded videos of hypertension   patients' talking about their medical histories helped another group of patients with high blood pressure to control their condition over several months.
   Houston was surprised by their studies that suggested that communication can be a powerful tool in medicine. They showed that those who had had similar experiences, when talking to someone with a similar background, could help change their behavior to become healthier. Hypertension is difficult to control, since it is dependent on diet, exercise and mental state. Medical treatments with drugs, and lifestyle therapies  have been  ly ineffective because people find it hard to follow those medical requirements.
   In the test, his team carefully chose their story-tellers from 230 members of a patients' community with whom they could most easily relate. Next, they divided their study population into two groups. One received three interactive   DVDs containing the tellers' stories of their experiences in living with and treating their hypertension. The other were given educational discs on an unrelated health topic. The study volunteers reported that they had listened to the DVDs, and after three months, those who heard the stories of the hypertensive patients lowered their blood pressure.
  While the study did not  _ how the story-telling influenced the patients' behavior, Houston suspects that watching patients of similar backgrounds who had a similar medical experience helped to motivate them to seek medical help to their hypertension. They found that after six months the difference in blood pressure between those who watched the story-tellers and those who observed the unrelated videos remained, suggesting that the story-telling continued to have an effect.","{

"Batteries can power anything from small sensors to large systems.While scientists are finding ways to make them smaller but even more powerful, problems can arise when these batteries are much larger and heavier than the devices themselves.University of Missouri(MU) researchers are developing a nuclear energy source that is smaller, lighter and more efficient.
""To provide enough power, we need certain methods with high energy density "",said Jae Kwon, assistant professor of electrical and computer engineering at MU.""The radioisotope  battery can provide power density that is much higher than chemical batteries.""
Kwon and his research team have been working on building a small nuclear battery, presently the size and thickness of a penny, intended to power various micro / nanoelectromechanical systems (M/NEMS).Although nuclear batteries can cause concerns, Kwon said they are safe.
""People hear the word 'nuclear' and think of something very dangerous,"" he said, ""However, nuclear power sources have already been safely powering a variety of devices, such as pace-makers, space satellites and underwater systems.""
His new idea is not only in the battery's size, but also in its semiconductor .Kwon's battery uses a liquid semiconductor rather than a solid semiconductor.
""The key part of using a radioactive battery is that when you harvest the energy, part of the radiation energy can damage the lattice structure  of the solid semiconductor,"" Kwon said, ""By using a liquid semiconductor, we believe we can minimize that problem.""
Together with J.David Robertson, chemistry professor and associate director of the MU Research Reactor, Kwon is working to build and test the battery.In the future, they hope to increase the battery's power, shrink its size and try with various other materials.Kwon said that battery could be thinner than the thickness of human hair.","{

"Alexandra Scott was born to Liz and Jay Scott in Manchester,Connecticut on January 18, 1996,the second of four children. Shortly before her first birthday,Alex was diagnosed with neuroblastoma,a type of childhood cancer.
On her first birthday, the doctors informed Alex's parents that if she beat her cancer it was doubtful that she would ever walk again. Just two weeks later,Alex slightly moved her leg at her parents' request to kick. This was the first indication that she would turn out to be a courageous and confident child with big dreams and big accomplishments.
By her second birthday,Alex was able to stand up with leg braces  .She worked hard to gain strength and to learn how to walk. She appeared to be overcoming the difficulties, until the shocking discovery within the next year that her tumors  had started growing again. In the year 2000,the day after her fourth birthday,Alex received a stem cell transplant  and informed her mother,""When I get out of the hospital I want to have a lemonade stand.

"I lost my left eye just after my first birthday -- I'd fallen seriously ill. My artificial eye was very convincing and I usually wore glasses over it -- even my boyfriend, Mick, didn't really notice. I told him I was blind in one eye just before we got married -- I was 19 at the time. He said he didn't care and that he loved me just the same.
The day before we married, I was at my parents' house, when my other eye suddenly went blurry  . My dad phoned the doctor, who told him it was probably nerves  and I'd be fine by morning. He was right -- when I awoke, I was able to read my good luck cards.
The wedding photographer arrived just as I was putting on my dress and I was called into the garden for a pre-ceremony photo. There was no time even to look in a mirror. Afterwards, we drove straight to the church.
It was a sunny day, and as we approached I could see all our friends waiting. The service was delightful, and Mick and I went into the minister's office to sign the register -- the last thing I ever wrote with my sight.
It was only when we reached the hotel, where the reception was taking place, that I started to feel strange. As we waited to greet our guests, my sight started to become blurry again and I really had to concentrate as our friends and family lined up to congratulate us. Afterwards, we went into the reception room, so the photographer could take our picture as we pretended to cut the cake. That's when the pain started.
""Don't let anyone know!""my mum said. She'd always blamed herself for the loss of my other eye, wishing she'd taken me to the doctor earlier. Only a few family members had ever been told -- even my close friends had beennone the wiser.
So even as the pain became more severe, I carried on as if nothing was happening. I'd waited so long for this day, and everyone seemed so happy, I didn't want to spoil things.
I couldn't make anything out, but I managed tostay calm and made it through the meal and the speeches. I suppose it's normal for the bride and groom to stay close together after a wedding, and Mick led me around properly. We took regular dance lessons, so the first dance passed without incident, Mick leading me in a slow, graceful waltz.
Afterwards, we left the building to see if a bit of air would improve the situation, but it didn't help, and nor did a lie-down. I still thought the blurriness would pass, as it had the night before. But I finally accepted that things just weren't going to get better on their own -- I was in so much pain.
Mick sent for a doctor, who took one look at me and called for an ambulance. At the hospital, I remember a nurse bursting into tears when she saw me arrive -- I still had confetti   in my hair.
I was diagnosed with glaucoma, a disease in the eye that causes terrible pressure -- it was unrelated to the problems I'd had as a child, just a coincidence. An operation to try to save my sight seemed successful at first -- as the bandages were removed, I remember seeing a vase of flowers at the end of the bed. But it's the last thing I ever saw.
It was hard, but I coped, and nearly 40 years on I feel I've had a full and active life. There are sights I'll always feel sad not to have seen -- the face of the daughter and my grandchildren. I'll always regret not finding the time to look in the mirror on the morning of my wedding, too -- despite everything that happened, I have happy memories of the ceremony.","{

"We've all heard the phrase ""love is patient"", but one couple in prefix = st1 /Michigan, took this phrase to a whole new level. On Monday, February 13, Willard Mason sat down to talk about his relationship with the love he lost more than 60 years ago. Good fortune and fate recently helped the couple reunite.
In 1941, Willard Mason and Llah Ost, both senior 2 students, became engaged to be married and began planning their lives together. But Willard moved away to work at Willow Run Bomber Plant, where he met and fell in love with a woman named Helvi. He broke off his long distance engagement to Llah and married Helvi in 1942. Llah later found love with someone else. Both had happy marriages and raised families. 
Then, in 2003, Helvi died. A year later, Willard found himself back in his hometown, where by chance, he ran into Llah's brother. He informed Willard of the death of Llah's husband, and encouraged him to call her. 
After that first phone call, the couple began dating. Willard made the drive from his home near Houghton Lake to Llah's home in Adrian. On one such trip, he blacked out, and his car hit a tree. He was rushed to a hospital, where tests showed that he needed a new pacemaker . Willard moved closer to Adrianand asked Llah to move in with him. She gladly accepted.
""We get along perfectly,"" Willard told AZ Central on Monday. ""We've never had an argument, she's a great cook, and she takes care of me."" 
Although both Willard and Llah are saddened by the 62 years they spent without each other, neither seem to have any regrets. Willard told AZ Central, ""You don't know how our lives might have turned out if we'd gotten married in 1941, but now she has a wonderful family, and so do I.""","{

"First Man-Bear-Pig, and now global warming; it seems Al Gore never stops to surprise the world. Recently Al Gore produced the movie An Inconvenient Truthwhich explained the threats and told us how to control global warming. What it left out is that there is no proof that human activity is even causing global warming, let alone if global warming is even taking place.
Global warming is the idea that greenhouse gases that shut in infra-red   radiation in the earth' s atmosphere are becoming more powerful and heating our planet up. The theory is that if the planet continues to heat up the polar ice caps could melt and cover the earth in water.
Over the last 100 years the Earth has increased one degree in temperature, and sea level has risen millimeters. Even though this ""eye-opening"" news is taking place, there is no clear proof saying that it is due to global warming. It could be just a regular weather pattern the earth is circulating. The polar ice caps have not grown or reduced in size since man began tracking them. Also the ground-based temperature has remained the same besides growing cities. In fact most clues support the idea that global warming is not taking place and human activity isn't causing any earth to melt down.
Although Al Gore insists the world is on its way to certain destruction, the facts say otherwise. It seems that driving to work won' t lead to the doom ( ) of mankind, and the movie Water World won' t be happening any time soon.","{

"Sir,
    The majority(=Most) of your readers must have been surprised and shocked to read a letter from Mr.R.Hogg,published in last Wednesday's Herald.Mr.Hogg seems to think that his own convenience and that of motorists in general are the only things that matter in our city.
    I would have supported Mr.Hogg if he had just made suggestions to improve the situation.No doubt his problems would be partly solved if the local government built a multi-storey car park in the city center,instead of encouraging motorists to use public transport.All the same,judging from the tone of Mr.Hogg's letter,I suspect that motorists who are so careless of pedestrians' safety that they would rather park their ears on the pavement than hold up the traffic would probably be too lazy to use a multi-storey car park if they had to walk a few hundred yards to their destination afterwards.
    My main reason for writing,however,is much more important.Does Mr.Hogg realize that,according to figures  showed by the Department of Transport,13,000 people were knocked down in Britain last year because of ears being illegally parked either on the pavement or on crossings? In fact,although the total pedestrian casualty  rate has fallen over the last ten years,there has been an increase in accidents caused when pedestrians have to step out into the mad to avoid parked cars on the pavement and cannot see oncoming traffic.
    I cannot share Mr.Hogg's view that the government have paid little attention to""long-suffering motorists"":and I think the punishment for dangerous parking should be made severe enough to stop all motorists from breaking the law in this way.
A WALKER,

"Contrary to many people believe, highly intelligent children are not necessarily certain to achieve academic success. In fact, so-called gifted students may fail to do well because they are unusually smart. Ensuring that a gifted child reaches his or her potential requires an understanding of what can go wrong and how to satisfy the unusual learning requirements of extremely bright young people.
One common problem gifted kids face is that they, and those around them, place too much importance on being smart. Such an emphasis can encourage a belief that bright people do not have to work hard to do well. Although smart kids may not need to work hard in the lower grades, when the work is easy, they may struggle and perform poorly when the work gets harder because they do not make the effort to learn. If the academic achievement of highly intelligent children remains below average for an extended period, many teachers will fail to recognize their potential. As a result, such students may not get the encouragement they need, further depressing their desire to learn. They may fall far behind in their schoolwork and even develop behavior problems.
IQ is just one element among many in the recipe for success--Children develop well or struggle in school for a host of reasons apart from IQ. These include motivation and persistence, social competence, and the support of family, educators and friends. 
Because highly gifted children solve the most varied thought problems faster and more thoroughly than those with more average talents do, they need additional intellectual stimulation while they wait for the rest of the kids to learn the basics. Two central approaches are used to satisfy the educational needs of such children: acceleration and enrichment. Acceleration means studying material that is part of the standard subjects for older students. Enrichment involves learning information that falls outside the usual subjects.
A child might skip one or more grades as a way of accelerating in school. But being with older children for the entire school day--and perhaps for grade-based extracurricular activities such as sports--can make a child feel inferior in every filed outside of academics. One very bright fourth-grader who had skipped two grades remained far ahead of his classmates intellectually, but as his classmates reached adolescence, his social and other shortcomings became painfully apparent. While acceleration is not an option, or not a good one, enrichment can be. After all, school is not a race but an adventure in learning. As such, the goal is not finishing first but absorbing as much knowledge as possible in the time assigned. Thus, providing opportunities for a child to study topics outside the regular subjects can be at least as valuable as pushing him or her through the required material faster.","{

"The south and east of the Great Lakes is famous for the huge amounts of snow it receives. When the snow starts to fall every year, people start discussing the phrase ""lake-effect snow"".
Lake-effect snow which is influenced by the movement of cold air over the relatively warm water of the Great Lakes often comes in late autumn and early winter. Because of the at least 20 degrees' difference between the lake water and the overrunning air, it's easy to form huge amounts of snow.
As the cool air crosses the water of Great Lakes, the lowest levels of the atmosphere begin to warm and pick up moisture. This newly warmed atmosphere is lighter than the cold air above it, so it starts rising. As the changed air continues to climb higher and higher, it finally meets much colder atmosphere which changes the moisture into water drops and ice, forming clouds. After this course repeats a number of times, the clouds become heavier and heavier, and then they are changed into snow and fall down.
The most important point that decides the amount of snowfall is the direction of the wind. If the wind runs perpendicularly across the lake, there won't be plenty of time for clouds to develop. However, if the wind runs in the opposite direction, clouds will form easily. The longer the cold air travels over the lake, the more moisture it is able to produce, which leads to a greater amount of snow.
The largest amount of the lake-effect snow was found across the U.P. of Michigan, the northwestern Pennsylvania and the far southwestern and northwestern New York, which are all along the south or east of the Great Lakes. It has been over 100 inches of snowfall in a winter season.","{

"A  At a recent visit to the beautiful Keukenhof flower gardens in Holland, I learned about the practice of topping.As flowers grow, sometimes the growers cut off the tops of the flowers, which they believe causes the plants to invest more energy into flower growth and less into seed production.The expected result is flower buds that will produce higher quality flowers.
This is the same with personal growth.Sometimes when we produce first results in a certain area, it can be helpful to cut them off and throw them away.This can free up energy for a stronger attempt elsewhere instead of settling into the comfort zone of satisfaction with the old results.
After running my computer games business for 10 years and getting satisfying results with it, I decided to drop it and leave that field behind.This freed up my energy to focus on my personal development writing and speaking.If I'd kept running the old business, this would have meant less energy to invest in my new path.
It can be difficult to choose the topping approach because you're taking something that's already reasonably satisfying and cutting it out of your life, in the hopes that something even better will grow in its place.
Do you want to settle where you are right now? If so, then topping is unnecessary.But if you'd like to do better and believe you have a good shot at improvement, just like the flower growers at Keukenhof, then topping is a sensible practice.To free up time and energy for future growth in new directions, you have to drop the merely satisfactory.This gives you a shot at the truly beautiful.
Stepping outside of your comfort zone is by definition an uncomfortable experience, but it can result in a lot more growth than staying put.Though dropping satisfaction to go for more growth is not an easy path to follow, I do find it to be the more beautiful path.","{

"Scrooge looked around him angrily. It was Christmas and his only friend Jacob Marley, had been dead for seven years. What was there for him to celebrate? He listened with growing anger to the people calling out greetings in the street and _ his nephew Bob Cratchit, who was just ready to go home. ""Merry Christmas, uncle,"" called Bob as he hurried out of the door.
Scrooge sighed. He might just as well go to bed. Aware that he should not waste his candle, he quickly undressed and climbed into bed. But no sooner had he done so than the ghost of Marley, covered in chains, appeared. ""What's the matter, Jacob?"" he asked. ""There are the chains I made in my life,"" answered the ghost. ""I'm forced to wander around with no rest and no peace. I have come here to warn you that if you do not change, this too will be your fate. You will be visited by three spirits. Expect the first one tomorrow when the clock strikes one. Expect the second and the third on the following nights at the same hour."" With that Marley vanished. ""Nonsense!"" he said and going back to bed, fell fast asleep.
When Scrooge awoke it was dark. The clock struck one. At the sound, light flashed into the room and there stood a young boy. ""Who are you?"" asked Scrooge in an unsteady voice. ""I'm the spirit of Christmas past,"" replied the spirit. ""Come with me."" ""Do you remember this?"" he asked. Scrooge did. He heard the happy cries of people, and looking around he found himself, as he used to be, sitting on a chair and reading. It was a Christmas. Suddenly Scrooge watched his younger self joined in a band, dancing and laughing. ""Strange,"" said the spirit, ""that such little things should make people so happy."" The ghost let him go and Scrooge sank down into a deep sleep.
When he awoke again the second night, the clock sounded one again. Before he doubted the second spirit already turned up. The fat and jolly spirit was smiling,""I'm the spirit of Christmas present.""Again Scrooge grasped the spirit's hand and was transported to a small house filled with a number of children and their mother. ""Why, it's my nephew Bob's house,"" cried Scrooge in astonishment. His surprise increased when the door opened and in came Bob carrying a small, sick boy, Tiny Tim. ""Sit down,"" cried Bob to his family. ""Let's have the best Christmas dinner!"" They all began to eat eagerly. Scrooge watched at the happiness and contentment of his poor nephew's family. ""A Merry Christmas to us all!"" cried Bob. ""God bless us everyone!"" added Tiny Tim, who sat very close to his father and Bob held his thin hand tightly. ""No, not for the uncle, but for you and the children. Nobody knows better than you how mean that man is."" exclaimed Bob's wife. ""Spirit,"" cried Scrooge. ""Will Tiny Tim live?"" ""If the future remains the same,"" said the spirit, ""there will be an empty chair next year."" Again the spirit moved Scrooge away, and he fell asleep as he fell back into his bed.
The third night he woke and waited for the hour and the third spirit. This time the spirit didn't come in a flash of light but arrived quietly wearing a black cloth that covered its face and form. ""I'm the spirit of Christmas that is to come."" The spirit pointed and led him to a large stone. It was at the foot of a grave  that was clearly neglected. Scrooge looked closer with trembling fingers and with horror read his own name on the stone. ""Oh, spirit, no, no!"" The spirit's finger remained steady pointing at the grave. ""I will honour Christmas in my heart and try to keep it all the year,"" cried Scrooge in terror. He reached out to hold the spirit's hand, but it slipped away. Scrooge looked around him. he saw he was in his own bed with his own thing around him.
""I have learned from the past, present and the future,"" he rushed to the window and shouted to the boys below: ""What day is it today?"" ""Why, it's Christmas Day,"" they replied in amazement. ""Wonderful,"" cried Scrooge. He rushed to his office to wait for Bob. When he entered, Scrooge pretended to look angry. ""Do you know what day it is, my boy?"" he asked Bob. ""I'm not going to stand for this any longer,"" he continued, ""and so I'm going to raise your salary."" Bob looked amazed. ""A Merry Christmas, Bob,"" cried Scrooge slapping him on the back. ""I want to help you and your family. Let's talk about it this very afternoon.""","{

"America is a mobile society. Friendships between Americans can be close and real, yet disappear soon. They don't feel hurt .If the same two people meet again, even years later, they _ the friendship. This can be quite difficult for us Chinese to understand. Friendships between us develop more slowly but may become lifelong feelings, extending   deeply into both families.
There is another difficult point for us to understand .Although Americans treat friends warmly in their personal everyday lives, they don't show their politeness to them if it requires a great deal of time. But in China, we are usually generous with our time. We, as hosts, will appear at an airport even in the middle of the night to meet a friend. We may take days off from our work to act as guides to our friends. It is opposite in America .Americans can not manage the time to do a great deal with a visitor outside their daily plans. They will probably expect the visitors to get themselves from the airport to the hotels. And they expect the visitors will phone them from there. Once the visitors arrive at their homes, the welcome will be full, warm and real.
For Americans, it is often considered more friendly to invite a friend to their homes than to restaurants, except for business matters. Americans are ready to receive us foreigners at their homes, share their holidays, and their home life .So accept their hospitality  at home and enjoy your visit in America !","{

"A predator  kills and eats other animals as prey .Sometimes it also becomes food for other predators. Polar bears are the largest of all the land predators. They can run across snow and swim in icy water for hours without rest. Their favorite food is seal. Not all big animals live on small animals. Hippos have heavy bodies and huge mouths. But they don't eat animals. They just eat grass.
Some predators use speed to catch their prey. Cheetahs are the fastest animals on land. They can run up to 70km an hour. Other predators use their senses to find their food. Sharks can see, smell, hear, feel and taste. They can also sense electrical currents( )from other animals' bodies. Some fish try to hide themselves, but with this sixth sense, sharks can always find them. Sharks have smooth bodies. This helps them swim without using lots of energy. They need to save their energy because they never really sleep and never stop hunting. Flying is a useful skill for many predators in the sky. The butcher bird is the most interesting predator. It has a special way of eating its prey. First it kills its prey. Then it hangs it on a fence or in a tree, just like a butcher hangs meat in his shop. Finally, it eats its prey.
Some people hunt and kill more animals than any other predator. They not only hunt for food. They also hunt for fun. They kill sharks for their fins, and tigers for skins. Those human hunters are the worst predators on Earth.","{

"Bolivia has a population of three and a half million. About one tenth of the total population are white; one-fourth are mixed Indians and white; and more than half are full-blooded Indians. The government and the industries are under the control of the white people.  
The Indians today live in much the same way as their ancestors. Most of them are farmers. Many work in the mines, for mining is the most important industry on Bolivia's. Of all the mining products, tin is the most important, which makes up three-fourths of all Bolivia's exports. The eastern slopes of the Andes, since there are very few roads there, are fertile but not highly developed. The two primary means of transportation are river boats and porters. East of the hill region is the great plains where tropical plants are grown. A serious problem for Bolivia is the transport of food from the warm regions, where it is grown, to the mountainous regions, where most of the people live.

"Team building games can be fun for teenagers. They can also be tools for strengthening the group. There are many levels of team building exercises. Let's look at some activities that can help you build a stronger team.
Pass the Clap
Pass the Clap works well as a beginning activity to help your group get to know each other. Have the participants stand in a circle. One person starts the clap and then turns to face the person next to him. As they are about to make eye contact, they clap together. That next person now has the clap and he has to pass it on. Continue to pass the clap around the circle.
Blindfolded Birthday
Blindfolded Birthday works well after people have become a little more familiar with each other. Everyone puts on a blindfold. Then, without talking, they have to line up in order of birthdays.
Two Truths and a Lie
Two truths and a Lie can be played anytime in the group's operations. Have the participants sit in a circle. Each person is supposed to tell two truths and a lie about themselves. The group has to guess which is the lie.
Human Knot
Human Knot is an activity best played after your group has gotten quite familiar with each other, because there can be a lot of touching going on. Everyone gathers in a circle. They put their right hands in the middle of the circle. They grab someone else's hand. Then the left hands go in the middle and they grab someone else's hand. The group is now knotted up. The object of Human Knot is to untie the group without letting go of any hands.","{

"Thirdgeneration mobile phones, known as 3G, are the next big step for the telecom industry. Data speed in 3G networks is much quicker than present technology. This means users can have highspeed Internet access and enjoy video and CDquality music on their phones.
 ""Mobile data is not a dream; it's not an option but a requirement."" said Len Lauer, head of a US communications company,Sprint PCS,at a 3G conference in Bangkok earlier this month.
With 3G, you can forget about text messages telling you yesterday's news; a 3G phone can receive video news programs, updated four times a day. Internet access will also be much quicker, making it easier to surf the Web on your phone than on your computer at home.
Facetoface video calls
And don't worry about getting lost. 3G phones offer map services so you can find a new restaurant just by pressing a few keys on your handset.
However, the most impressive part of 3G technology is video calling. With live twoday video communication, you can have facetoface talks with friends and family on your mobile phone.
Many European countries have already launched the service. In May 2000 the US Government issued five licenses to run 3G wireless services, while the first 3G phones arrived in Italy in March this year.
International telecom companies can't wait to sell 3G in China, the world's largest mobile telecommunications market. But they will have to be patient. At the moment, China is busy testing its 3Gbased technologies, networks and services. This will be followed by a trial period before the phones can finally hit the shops.
""We need to create a pool of 3G customers before the largescale commercial launch of the service."" said Fan Yunjun, marketing manager for Beijing Mobile. ""We expect that the 3G licenses will be issued late next year. ""","{

""answer"": ""A"",

"If you have a watch, don't go to a watchmaker's unless something is wrong with the machinery. Once I had a beautiful watch. And it had kept perfect time. But one night it happened that I forgot to _ it _  . Next morning I went to a watchmaker as I wanted my perfect watch to be set by the exact time. He examined it and said, ""The regulator   must be pushed up as your watch is four minutes slow.
I tried to stop him from doing so, but he didn't listen and pushed the regulator.
My beautiful watch began to gain. It gained faster and faster day by day. By the end of the second month it had left all the clocks and watches of the town far behind.
I could do nothing but take it to another watchmaker to be regulated. I expected him to regulate the watch at once, but he asked me to come in a week's time. When at last I got my watch back from him, it began to slow down. And I failed to be in time for trains, business affairs, and even missed my dinners.
Now I went to a third watchmaker. When I was waiting for him to repair my poor watch, he took it to pieces and said that he would try to finish this work in three or four days. What I could do was to nod my head. After that, my watch went for half a day, and then stopped. So I kept taking my watch from one watchmaker to another. But each watchmaker disappointed me.

Tourists also love backpacks. With convenient backpacks, backpackers can move freely from one place to another. Meanwhile, they can also free their hands to do other things like taking photos.
But in the very beginning backpacks were not what we see today.
It is thought that US hiker Dick Kelty invented the first modern backpack in 1951. He used nylon   and aluminum tubing   to make backpacks lightweight. Then he added shoulder straps   and waist straps to transfer  much of the weight to the hips  .

"Several years ago, I read a book Your Money or Your Life, written by Joe Domingguez and Vicki Robin. The major theme of the book is the idea that if you want to cut your spending, you'll have to begin by stopping trying to impress other people.
The authors divide people into two groups : people whose opinions you care about, and people whose opinions you don't care about one way or another. It's easy to stop caring about people whose opinions you don't care about. Who cares what they think ? As long as you're not doing something truly immoral ---- something that might potentially create a negative reputation for you ---- it doesn't matter what they think.
But shouldn't you impress other people whose opinions you do care about ? Anyway, they are people you want to meet : customers, friends and family.
The answer is that you don't need to impress those people with expensive, shiny things. The relationship you've built with them ---- or you're going to build with them ---- is based on you, not on the material items. They'll either like you for you or they won't. 
To put it simply, take care of the basics. Keep yourself clean. Keep your weight under control. Wear reasonable clothing. Work on your communication skills. If you have them covered, you don't need to invest time and money in impressing other people.
Coming to this realization is incredibly valuable. It drops your clothing budget. It drops your automobile budget. It drops your electronics budget. It drops your housing budget. You don't need a shiny car, an iPhone, or a $50 haircut.
Yes , you may actually still want one or two of these things, but the impetus  comes from what your personal values are, not what other people around you seem to value or what marketing messages you receive.
For some people, it seems impossible. Their social cues come from advertising-laden media and from friends who also get their cues from advertising-laden media.They believe they need a slick cellphone and $100 casual clothes. Their self-worth revolves around that little burst they get from impressing others.
People should learn to break through that situation. In short, don't play socially by the tiring old rules that revolve around needing to impress people. Instead, spend your time on things that bring real value to you and give real value to others.","{

"Googlefight is a simple service available on the Internet which offers you the chance to compare two different items and see how many hits they get on the Google search engine. The seemingly simple device has proved invaluable to users, especially to help win arguments.
For example, imagine that you and your friends are arguing about who are the most popular music or movie stars, you can decide the argument by writing the names in the Googlefight boxes. Let's say that you are arguing about Jackie Chan and Jet Li. You will quickly discover that Jet Li is mentioned 16 million times on Google pages, whereas Jackie Chan is mentioned a mere 12 million times! In this unscientific way, you can claim victory for one Star over another.
But teachers have come up with ways of using Googlefight which are much more useful from an academic point of view, particularly when it comes to studying languages. You can, for example, find out the frequency of two words with the same meaning, and deduce   from the answers which one is more common. For example, let's take the words ""buy"" and ""purchase"", which mean the same thing (although ""buy"" is only a verb and ""purchase"" is both a verb and a noun). It is immediately clear from Googlefight that ""buy"" is much more commonly used, with a massive three and a half billion hits, compared to only one billion occurrences for the more formal word.
But the real value of Googlefight to the language learner is in determining which is the more common of two phrases. For example, ""raining cats and dogs"" is an old-fashioned English expression about the weather. Do English speakers still use it? Or are they more likely to say ""pouring down""? Googlefight suggests the latter. ""Pouring down"" has 898,000 Google hits, whereas ""raining cats and dogs"" only has 326,000.
With phrases, it's important to remember that you need to use quote marks to make the search more accurate. For example, if you type in the similar phrases ""look after"" and ""take care of "" without quote marks, the second phrase seems to be more common, but with quote marks, the result is reversed.","{
""question"": ""Language teachers find it useful because   _  ."",

"Carrying a passenger on a bicycle is an offence punishable by law. Everyone knows that but still some of us do it.
I had done it many times before until something happened to teach me never to do it again. It was not the police. Rather it was an unforgettable, and unpleasant, experience.
It happened one evening when my friend Segaran and I wanted to go and visit another friend who lived some distance away. I had a bicycle. Segaran did not. So, as usual, he sat side-saddle on the horizontal bar of the bicycle while I pedalled. We had done it many times before, so it should not be any problem.
Near my friend's house, we got onto a gravel  path made slippery by the recent rain. Still we managed to move along, thoroughly enjoying the rough ride.
As we passed by a stream, I made the mistake of going too near the bank. The rain had softened the soil and it could not hold our combined weight. One moment we were going along merrily, the next we were tumbling head over heels into the stream.
Splash! Splash! Splash! We plunged into the river bicycle first, followed by Segaran, then me. Normally the stream is only a few centimetres deep with clear water. When we fell in, it was a metre deep with smelly black water. The water prevented us from getting badly injured but we also had to pay the price of swallowing some of it. It tasted horrible. Segaran got the worst of it for being sandwiched between the bicycle and me. Our pride was far more hurt.
We walked all the way home. I had to push the bicycle because its front wheel was bent out of shape. From that moment I promised never to carry anyone on a bicycle again.","{

"Have you ever seen people dance? Some dances are fast and others are slow. People's feet always move when they dance. They keep on moving until the music stops.
People have enjoyed dancing for a very long time. This story is of a different kind of dance. It is a dance without people or music. Yet this dance is one of the oldest in the world. It is the dance of bees.
If you have ever watched bees, you know that they are very clever. They also work hard looking for food and bringing it back to their home.
The home of the bees is called a bee hive. Here hundreds even thousand of bees live. They work day and night building small walls. There they make their honey. This is the same honey that we eat.
Where does the honey come from? Bees live on food from flowers. Have you seen bees flying around a flower garden? When a bee rests on a flower, it tries to go to the centre of it. There it takes in as much food as its body can hold. Then it flies to take the food back to the hive.
At the hive, bees change flower food into honey. Then they fly away for more food.
How do the bees know where to find the best food in the sweetest flowers? One bee acts as a guide. When it discovers good flowers, it flies back to the hive and tells the others. It does this by dancing for them.
The bee dances on one side. This tells the other bees which way to go to find the flowers. But that is not all. The bee dances for some time. And the length of its dance tells the other bees how far they must fly to reach the flowers.
When the bees see the dance, they know where the flowers are. They fly away and return with more food for the hive.
Sometimes we hear the music of the bees as they fly around. But few people have ever seen them dance. Yet without that dance we might never have sweet honey to eat.","{

"Dear All,
Happy New Year! A list of important dates for this term is attached to this letter.
Interviews for our April and September Primary One classes will take place on Tuesday and Wednesday,18th&19th January.Now is the time to apply for admission to Peak School.
Children are expected to wear their uniforms this term.As is usual at this time of the year,mornings at the school are quite cold and l would suggest children wear their sweaters to school.As the temperature goes up during the day,children tend to take off their outer clothes,so it is important that all sweatshirts are labeled .
I have received a few requests from parents asking if their children can wear summer uniforms this term.I am of the view that all children in the school should follow the school policy and be dressed in the appropriate uniforms.In the longer term,a number of US at school have questioned the need to have a winter and summer uniform.Perhaps.with careful consideration,we can develop a uniform that will serve children for the whole academic year.
As the foggy mornings start to appear,a number of parents have raised concerns over the safety of those children who walk to school.  Our dark green uniforms are not particularly visible to motorists.Hopefully, the ""Uniform Committee"" to be set up this term will deal with this particular issue.I will keep parents informed of the channels through which views may be expressed in future newsletters.
We still have a ""No Hat,No Play"" rule on the playground,so children need to ensure that they have their sunhats in school at all times.
Yours sincerely,
P D Tunesi

"""I see you've got a bit of water on your coat,"" said the man at the petrol station. ""Is it raining out there?""""No, it's pretty nice,"" I replied, checking my sleeve. ""Oh, right. A pony  bit me earlier.""
As it happened, the bite was virtually painless: more the kind of small bite you might get from a naughty child. The pony responsible was queuing up for some ice cream in the car park near Haytor, and perhaps thought I'd jumped in ahead of him.
The reason why the ponies here are naughty is that Haytor is a tourist-heavy area and tourists are constantly feeding the ponies foods, despite sighs asking them not to. By feeding the ponies, tourists increase the risk of them getting hit by a car, and make them harder to gather during the area's annual pony drift .
The purpose of a pony drift is to gather them up so their health can be checked, the baby ones can be stooped from feeding on their mother's milk, and those who've gone beyond their limited area can be returned to their correct area. Some of them are also later sold, in order to limit the number of ponies according to the rules set by Natural England.
Three weeks ago, I witnessed a small near-disaster a few mils west of here. While walking, I noticed a pony roll over on his back. ""Hello!"" I said to him, assuming he was just rolling for fun, but he was very still and, as I got closer, I saw him kicking his legs in the air and breathing heavily. I began to properly worry about him. Fortunately, I managed to get in touch with a Dartmoor's Livestock Protection officer and send her a photo. The officer immediately sent a local farmer out to check on the pony. The pony had actually been trapped between two rocks. The farmer freed him, and he began to run happily around again.
Dartmoor has 1,000 or so ponies, who play a critical role in creating the diversity of species in this area. Many people are working hard to preserve these ponies, and trying to come up with plans to find a sustainable  future for one of Dartmoor's most financially-troubled elements.","{

"The chimp didn't feel well. She fell over, ignoring the other wild chimps. Finally, the sick chimp crawled over to a bush, picked some leaves and swallowed them. By the next afternoon, the chimp was as good as new!
Biologists watching the chimp were surprised. Somehow, the plant had cured the chimp! Did the chimp know the plant would make her feel better? Or was it just a lucky accident?
Many scientists don't think it has anything to do with luck. They're discovering that some animals seem to use plants to cure themselves. And these animals are leading scientists to new plants that could cure humans!
Dr. Richard Wrangham, an anthropologist at Harvard University, agrees that animals may know something we don't know about forest plants.
Wrangham got to know chimps and their diets while studying them for three years in Tanzania. ""You must know a lot about an animal's feeding habits to know what it doesn't consider food,"" Wrangham explains. Every morning, he saw that most chimps ate fruit near their nests. Later on, they ate on leaves.
When he noticed chimps eating the leaves of a plant they usually ignored, Wrangham thought something interesting was going on---especially when he saw that they'd sometimes walk for 20 minutes to find the plant. Another strange thing that caught his eye was how they ate the bitter leaves.
""They swallowed the leaves whole,"" explains Wrangham, noting that chimps usually chew their food well. ""They seemed to rub the leaves around the roofs of their mouths. They closed their eyes, wrinkled their noses and swallowed slowly. ""
Wrangham wondered what could be so good about something tasting so bad. He had a chemist analyze the leaves. He discovered that the leaves contain a red oil that kills different viruses . Later tests showed that the oil might even fight cancer and the AIDS virus!
Why don't the chimps chew the leaves? ""Rubbing the leaves between the tongue and the inside of the mouth might allow the chemicals to enter the bloodstream directly,"" he suggests, ""instead of going to the stomach, where they might get destroyed by acids. The chimps seem to know what they're doing.""","{
""question"": ""How can Dr. Wrangham tell which plants are medicine for chimps?"",

"When I crossed a small road on my first day in Kolkata, I was surprised because I heard a bell-not a horn  ,  It was a tiny man pulling a rickshaw, He stopped and picked up two children from the front door of their house and pulled them to school. For many people, the rickshaw in Kolkata has many advantages, When the traffic is bad, rickshaws find a way through the traffic. If your miss your bus and there aren't any taxis, you can always find a rickshaw in Kolkata. Rickshaws are from your house to the market and waits for you. Then he loads  all your things, drops you off outside your home and helps you unload, No other type of public transport offers this kind of service.
From June to September, Kolkata gets heavy rain. Sometimes it rains for 48 hours without a break. In some parts of the city, the roads flood  , and anything with an engine  is useless, But the rickshaw drivers never stop working, even with water all around them.
But not everyone thinks rickshaws are a good thing. The local government want to ban rickshaws. They believe it is wrong for one man to pull another person when there is modern transport in the city. However, there is a problem with this plan. Many of the rickshaw drivers come from the countryside. The only job they can find in Kolkata is pulling a rickshaw, If the city bans rickshaws, these men won't have a job. So for the moment, the people of Kolkata still go by rickshaw.","{

"You went to the butcher's for meat, the pharmacy for aspirin, and the grocery store for food. But when I spent the summer with my Grandmother in Warwick, N.Y., she sent me down to the general store with a list. How could I hope to find anything on the packed, messy shelves around me?
I walked up to the counter. Behind it was a lady like no one I'd ever seen. Fake-jewel-encrusted glasses teetered  on the tip of her nose, gray hair was piled on her head.
""Excuse me,"" I said. She looked up.
""You're that Clements kid,"" she said. ""I'm Miss Bee. Come closer and let me get a look at you."" She pushed her glasses up her nose. ""I want to be able to describe you to the sheriff  if something goes missing from the store.""
""I'm not a thief!"" I was shocked. I was seven years old, too young to be a thief!
""From what I can see you're not much of anything. But I can tell you've got potential."" She went back to reading her newspaper.
""I need to get these."" I said, holding up my list.
""So? Go get them."" Miss Bee pointed to a sign on the screen door. ""There's no one here except you and me and I'm not your servant, so I suggest you get yourself a basket from that pile over there and start filling. If you're lucky you'll be home by sundown.""
Sundown was five hours away. I wasn't sure I would make it.
I scanned the nearest shelf for the first item on my list: pork and beans. It took me three wall-to-wall searches before I found a can nestled between boxes of cereal and bread. Next up was toilet paper, found under the daily newspaper. Band-Aids --where had I seen them? Oh, ye next to the face cream. The store was a puzzle, but it held some surprises too. I found a new Superman comic tucked  behind the peanut butter.
I visited Miss Bee a couple of times a week that summer. Sometimes she short-changed me. Other times she overcharged. Or sold me an old newspaper instead of one that was current. Going to the store was more like going into battle. I left my Grandma's house armed with my list--memorized to the letter--and marched into Miss Bee's like General Patton marching into North Africa.
""That can of beans is only twenty-nine cents!"" I corrected her one afternoon. I had watched the numbers change on the cash register closely, and Miss Bee had added 35 cents. She didn't seem embarrassed that I had caught her overcharging. She just looked at me over her glasses and fixed the price.
Not that she ever let me declare victory. All summer long she found ways to trip me up. No sooner had I learned how to pronounce bicarbonate of soda  and memorized its location on the shelf than Miss Bee rearranged the shelves and made me hunt for it all over again. By summer's end the shopping trip that had once taken me an hour was done in 15 minutes. The morning I was to return to Brooklyn, I stopped in to get a packet of gum.
""All right, Miss Potential,"" she said. ""What did you learn this summer?"" That you're a meany! I pressed my lips together. To my amazement, Miss Bee laughed. ""I know what you think of me,"" she said. ""Well, here's a news flash: I don't care! Each of us is put on this earth for a reason. I believe my job is to teach every child I meet ten life lessons to help them. Think what you will, Miss Potential, but when you get older you'll be glad our paths crossed!"" Glad I met Miss Bee? Ha! The idea was absurd.
Until one day my daughter came to me with homework troubles.
""It's too hard,"" she said. ""Could you finish my math problems for me?""
""If I do it for you how will you ever learn to do it yourself?"" I said. Suddenly, I was back at that general store where I had learned the hard way to tally up  my bill along with the cashier. Had I ever been overcharged since?
As my daughter went back to her homework, I wondered: Had Miss Bee really taught me something all those years ago? I took out some scrap paper  and started writing.","{

"On Tuesday,a new study published in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation:Heart Failure revealed that women who ate five or more dishes of baked fish a month had a thirty percent lower risk of heart failure in comparison to women who ate less than one dish a month.
Researchers examined the diets of 84,493 women,whose ages ranged from 50 to 79.The women who had eaten lots of baked fish like salmon ,were more healthy than those who mostly ate tuna or white fish. Eating baked fish also appeared to provide a protection against high blood pressure. The study also found that those women who ate more baked fish were likely to have a lower weight,exercise more and eat more fruits and vegetables in comparison to those who ate fried fish.
Researchers noted that past research had discovered the fatty acids in fish probably decreased the risk of high blood pressure by improving blood pressure along with heart and blood functioning. This study showed the link between eating fish and heart failure risk but it was not designed to show cause and effect.
This study also showed that just by eating one dish of fried fish a week led to a 49% greater risk of heart failure,and eating fried fish led to lower fiber intake and higher calorie intake.
The American Heart Association suggested eating a minimum of two dishes of fish especially fatty fish each week.","{

"Many people hurt their backs when they try to lift heavy things from the floor. It is easy to hurt your back muscle  when you try to pick up a heavy thing. However, there is a correct way to lift things from the floor. If you pick up heavy things correctly, you probably will not hurt your back.
To lift something from the floor correctly, first bend   your knees and lower yourself. Keep your back straight. Do not bent over, from your waist   keep your back and hips   and waist in a line. If you bent over, the muscles in your lower back can became hurt very easily. If you keep your back and hips straight, the muscles are stronger, because they hold up together. The other muscles can then help the lower back muscles.
As you lower yourself, try to get as close to thing as you can, put one knee on each side of the thing. Remember at all times to keep your back straight. Put your hand under the thing that is in front of you, between y our knees.
To lift the thing, you should stand up slowly. Use your leg muscles in order to stand up.

"True Manliness   
""Please, mother, do sit down and let me try my hand,""said Fred Liscom, a bright active boy, twelve years old. Mrs. Liscom, looking pale and worn, was moving languidly   about, trying to clear away the breakfast she had scarcely tasted.
She smiled and said, ""You, Fred, you wash dishes?""   
""Yes, indeed, mother,"" answered Fred. ""I should be a poor scholar if I couldn't, when I've seen you do it so many times. Just try me.""
A look of relief came over his mother's face as she seated herself in her low rocking chair. Fred washed the dishes and put them in the closet. He swept the kitchen, brought up the potatoes from the cellar for the dinner and washed them, and then set out for school.
Fred's father was away from home and as there was some cold meat in the pantry  , Mrs. Liscom found it an easy task to prepare dinner. Fred hurried home from school, set the table, and again washed the dishes.
He kept on in this way for two or three days, until his mother was able to resume her usual work. He felt amply rewarded when the doctor, who happened in one day, said, ""Well, madam, it's my opinion that you would have been very sick if you had not kept quiet.""
The doctor did not know how the ""quiet"" had been secured, nor how the boy's heart bounded at his words. Fred had given up a great deal of what boys hold dear, for the purpose of helping his mother, coasting and skating being just at this time in perfection.
Besides this, his temper and his patience had been severely tried. He had been in the habit of going early to school and staying to play after it was dismissed.
The boys missed him and their curiosity was excited when he would give no other reason for not coming to school earlier, or staying after school, than that he was ""Wanted at home.""
""I'll tell you,"" said Tom Barton, ""I'll find him out, boys-see if I don't!""
So, one morning on his way to school, he called on Fred. As he went around to the side door, he walked lightly and somewhat nearer the kitchen window than was  ly needful. Looking in, he saw Fred standing at the table with a dishcloth in his hand.   
Of course he reported this at school, and various were the greetings poor Fred received at recess  .""Well, you're a brave one to stay at home washing dishes!""""Girl boy!"" ""Pretty Bessie!""""Lost your apron, haven't you, Polly!""
Fred was not wanting either in spirit or in courage, and he was strongly tempted to resent these insults and to fight some of his tormentors  . But his consciousness of right and his love for his mother helped him.   
While he was struggling for self-mastery, his teacher appeared at the door of the schoolhouse. Fred caught his eye, and it seemed to look, if it did not say, ""Don't give up! Be really brave!"" He knew the teacher had heard the insulting taunts of his thoughtless schoolmates.   
The boys received notice during the day that Fred must not be taunted in any manner. They knew that the teacher meant what he said; and so the brave little boy had no further trouble.","{

"A young and handsome executive was driving down a neighborhood street. He thought he saw something. Then he slowed down, watching out for children rushing out from between parked cars. As his car passed, no kids appeared. Instead, a brick smashed into his door! He slammed on the brakes (make his car stop). The angry driver then jumped out of his car, caught the nearest child and pushed him up against a parked car, shouting, ""Who are you and what was that all about?""
The little boy was full of apology, ""Please,Mister... Please, I'm sorry...I didn't know what else I could do. I threw the brick because no one else would stop.""
With tears dripping down his face, the youth pointed to a spot just around a parked car. ""It's my brother,"" he said. ""He fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up.""
Now weeping, the boy asked the executive, ""Would you please help me to get him back into his wheelchair? He's hurt and he's too heavy for me.""

"All of us have taken an instant dislike to someone, and then felt guilty about being too judgmental. But now it seems we should place more trust in our first impressions. Most people can accurately judge a total stranger following a short meeting, according to scientists.
And in general, the more confident the people are, the more likely they are to be correct in their assumptions. Jeremy Biesanz, who led a team of researchers from the University of British Columbia, said: ""Many important decisions are made after very brief encounters -- which employee to hire, which person to date, which student to accept"". Although our first impressions are generally accurate, it is necessary for us to recognize where they may be not good enough.
The researchers arranged for two groups of more than 100 people to meet in a meeting. Much like speed-dating, the volunteers spoke to everyone in their group for three minutes each. At the end of each three-minute chat, they were asked to rate each other's personalities, and how well they thought their impressions ""would  _ someone who knows this person very well"".
To find out what the person was ""really"" like, the scientists had his friends and family fill out his personality reports. Generally speaking, the more confident the volunteers felt in accurately rating another's personality, the closer their ratings were to those of the other person's friends and family, the researchers said.
However, the participants with the highest accuracy were those who rated themselves moderately accurate -- those highly confident of their judgment were less successful. The scientists concluded that, although we know people are different from each other, a good judge of character knows that in many ways people are mostly alike. For example, almost everyone would prefer being kind to being unfriendly.
Therefore, while first impressions can be generally accurate, they are not conclusive in working out whether somebody really is ""better"" than someone else.","{

"Recent developments in astronomy have made it possible to detect planets in our own Milky Way and in other galaxies. This is a major achievement because,in   terms,planets are very small and do not give out light. Finding planets is proving hard enough, but finding life on them will prove  _ more difficult. The first question to answer is whether a planet can actually support life. In our own solar system,for example,Venus is far too hot and Mars is far too cold to support life. Only the Earth provides ideal conditions,and even here it has taken more than four billion years for plant and animal life to evolve .
    Whether a planet can support life depends on the size and brightness of its star, that is its ""sun"". Imagine a star up to twenty times larger, brighter and hotter than our own sun. A planet would have to be a very long way from it to be capable of supporting life. On the contrary, if the star were small,the life--supporting planet would have to have a close orbit round it and also provide the perfect conditions for life forms to develop. But how would we fund such a planet? At present, there is no telescope in existence that is capable of detecting the presence of life.  _ .
     It is impossible to look for life on another planet using earth--based telescopes. Our own warm atmosphere and the heat generated by the telescope would make it impossible to detect objects as small as planets. Even a telescope in orbit round the earth like the very successful Hubble telescope,would not be suitable because of the dust particles in our solar system. A telescope would have to be as far away as the planet Jupiter to look for life in outer space because the dust becomes thinner the further we travel towards the outer edges of our own solar system. Once we detected a planet,we would have to find a way of blocking out the light from its star, so that we would be able to ""see"" the planet properly and analyze its atmosphere. In the first instance, we would be looking for plant life,rather than ""little green men"" . The life forms most likely to develop on a planet would be bacteria. It is bacteria that have generated the oxygen we breathe on earth. For most of the earth's history they have been the only form of life on our planet. As Earth-dwellers,we always cherish the hope that we will be visited by little green men and that we will be able to communicate with them. But this hope only exists in science fiction. If we were able to discover lowly forms of life like bacteria on another planet,it would completely change our view of ourselves. As Daniel Goldin of NASA observed,""Finding life elsewhere would change everything. No human efforts or thought would be unchanged by it.""","{

"I got up and dressed, stuck my violin under my jacket, and went out into the street. I wandered about for an hour, looking for a likely place, feeling as if I were about to commit a crime. Then I stopped at last under a bridge near the station and decided to _ .
I felt tense and shaking. I drew my violin from under my coat like a gun. It was here, in Southampton, with trains passing overhead, that I was about to prove myself.
The first notes I played were loud and raw, and then they settled down and began to run more smoothly and to stay more or less in tune. To my surprise I was neither arrested nor told to shut up. Indeed, nobody took any notice at all.
I walked the streets of Southampton for several days, gradually knowing how to try and get money by being a street artist. It was not a good thing, for instance, to let the hat fill up with money -- the sight could discourage the people; nor was it wise to empty it completely, which could also confuse them, giving them no hint as to where to drop his money. Placing a couple of pennies in the hat to start the thing going soon became a good idea. Before I played another tune, I took off the big money, but always left two pennies behind.
Old ladies were most generous, and so were women with children, shop girls, and typists. As for the men: Heavy drinkers were always generous too and so were big young with muscles. But never a man with a hat, briefcase or dog; respectable types were the meanest of all, except retired army officers, who would bark ""Why aren't you working, young man?"" and then threw much money into the hat to hide their confusion.","{

"With only fish and birds for company, Eric Erden has been rowing across the Pacific Ocean to Australia in his 23-foot-long boat since he left California on July 10, 2009.
This is the first part of Eric's trip around the world using only his own energy. He will row, bike, and walk without help from any motors at all. His plan includes climbing the tallest mountain on each of the six continents he visits, to honour the memory of a fellow climber.
He says he is doing this to show kids that they can achieve any goal, but he also hopes to have some great adventures along the way.
Storms and huge waves regularly force him in the wrong direction and even threaten to overturn his boat. ""Sometimes I really feel scared,"" says a somewhat embarrassed Eric. ""But that's part of the journey. I knew this wouldn't be easy when I started.""
Protein bars give him energy, and he boils water to heat freeze-dried meals on a one-burner stove. A sun-powered machine removes salt from ocean water so he can drink it, but when that fails he sometimes tries to collect rainwater in a bucket.
He's not bothered by any of the hardships. Eric sees the world as a laboratory where there is much to learn. And when his trip around the world takes him across land, he enjoys meeting people -- especially children. He has already visited several schools and shared his story.","{

"My day began on a definitely sour note when I saw my six-year-old wrestling with a limb of my azalea bush. By the time I got outside, he'd broken it. ""Can I take this to school today?"" he asked. With a wave of my hand, I sent him off. I turned my back so he wouldn't see the tears gathering in my eyes.
The washing machine had leaked on my brand-new linoleum. If only my husband had just taken the time to fix it the night before when I asked him instead of playing checkers with Jonathan.
It was days like this that made me want to quit. I just wanted to drive up to the mountains, hide in a cave, and never come out.
Somehow I spent most of the day washing and drying clothes and thinking how love had disappeared from my life. As I finished hanging up the last of my husband's shirts, I looked at the clock. 2:30. I was late. Jonathan's class let out at 2:15 and I hurriedly drove to the school.
I was out of breath by the time I knocked on the teacher's door and peered through the glass. She rustled through the door and took me aside. ""I want to talk to you about Jonathan,"" she said.
I prepared myself for the worst. Nothing would have surprised me. ""Did you know Jonathan brought flowers to school today?"" she asked. I nodded, thinking about my favorite bush and trying to hide the hurt in my eyes. ""Let me tell you about yesterday,"" the teacher insisted. ""See that little girl?"" I watched the bright-eyed child laugh and point to a colorful picture taped to the wall. I nodded.
""Well, yesterday she was almost hysterical. Her mother and father are going through a nasty divorce. She told me she didn't want to live, she wished she could die. I watched that little girl bury her face in her hands and say loud enough for the class to hear, 'Nobody loves me.' I did all I could to comfort her, but it only seemed to make matters worse."" ""I thought you wanted to talk to me about Jonathan,"" I said.
""I do,"" she said, touching the sleeve of my blouse. ""Today your son walked straight over to that child. I watched him hand her some pretty pink flowers and whisper, 'I love you.'""
I felt my heart swell with pride for what my son had done. I smiled at the teacher. ""Thank you,"" I said, reaching for Jonathan's hand, ""you've made my day.""
Later that evening, I began pulling weeds from around my azalea bush. As my mind wandered back to the love Jonathan showed the little girl, a biblical verse came to me: ""...these three remain: faith, hope and love. But the greatest of these is love."" While my son had put love into practice, I had only felt anger.
I heard the familiar squeak of my husband's brakes as he pulled into the drive. I snapped a small limb bristling with hot pink azaleas off the bush. I felt the seed of love that God planted in my family beginning to bloom once again in me. My husband's eyes widened in surprise as I handed him the flowers. ""I love you,"" I said.","{

"""We do look very different; we're older. Leo's 38, I'm 37. We were 21 and 22 when we made that film. You know, he's fatter now -- I'm thinner."". So says Kate Winslet, who is thrilled at the 3-D re-release ofTitanicto coincide with the 100th anniversary of the ship's demise. "" It happens every time I get on any boat of any kind."" She recalls. There are all the people who want her to walk to the front of the ship and re-create her famous pose, arms flung wide. Most people remember the tragedy: The British passenger ship -- said to be unsinkable -- hit an iceberg and sank on April 15, 1912, during its maiden voyage from England to New York City. More than 1,500 people died. But little known is what the world learned from the sinking to prevent future incidents.
Probably the greatest deficiency  of the Titanic was that she was built 40 years before the widespread use of the wonderful invention radar . Her only defense against icebergs and hidden obstacles was to rely on manned lookouts. On that fateful night the eyesight of trained lookouts only provided 37 seconds of warning before the collision.
Traveling at nearly 30 miles an hour the Titanic was moving far too fast to avoid the huge iceberg. The warning did prevent a head-on collision as the officer on the bridge managed to turn the ship slightly.
The last ship to send a warning was the California. She was within ten miles of the Titanic during the disaster, but her radio operator went to bed at midnight and never received any of the SOS messages from the Titanic. That was one of the important lessons learned from the catastrophe, the need for 24-hour radio operators on all passenger liners.
Another lesson learned was the need for more lifeboats. The Titanic remained afloat  for almost three hours and most of the passengers could have been saved with enough lifeboats.
1,500 passengers and workers died in the 28 degree waters of the Atlantic. Out of the tragedy, the sinking did produce some important maritime reforms. The winter travel routes were changed to the south and the Coast Guard began to keep an eye on the location of all icebergs. The new rules for lifeboats were obvious to all. There must be enough lifeboats for everybody on board.
The most important lesson learned was that no one would ever again consider a ship unsinkable- no matter how large or how well constructed. Never again would sailors place their faith in a ship above the power of the sea.","{

"Many birds migrate. This means that every year they fly somewhere warm in the winter and then return to the place they came from in the spring. One mystery is how birds know how to travel such long distances without getting lost. Scientists have wondered for years whether they are born with the knowledge of where to go or whether they learn it after they are born. Now, researchers have found evidence that shows that one type of bird, at least, learns how to migrate.
The bird is the whooping crane , a tall, white bird that lives in the United States. In the 1940s, the number of these birds decreased to fewer than 25 individuals, and many people feared that they would die out. Thanks to efforts to save them, they have now increased to about 600. However, the birds are not very good at taking care of their young. Because of this, eggs are brought to a site in Maryland. There, scientists from the Whooping Crane Eastern Partnership raise the baby birds.
Later, the young birds are taken from Maryland to Wisconsin, where the scientists teach them how to fly. From there, they fly about 2,200 kilometers south to Florida to spend the winter. The first time, scientists lead the way in a small airplane. From the second year, though, the birds travel by themselves. For 14 years, the scientists have kept a careful record of every flight the birds have taken between Wisconsin and Florida. They have also recorded which birds fly together, the relationships between the birds, and the gender of each bird.
When scientists analyzed the data, they were surprised by the results. These showed that each bird took a very different route. However, as they got older, they flew more and more directly between Wisconsin and Florida. This continued until they were five years old. This indicates that the birds gradually learned the best route to take. Moreover, when an older bird was in a group, the whole group flew more directly. This suggests that the older birds taught the younger ones a quicker route. Scientists say that this evidence marks a big step toward solving the mystery of bird migration.","{
""question"": ""What do we learn from the data?"",
""options"": [
""Most birds like to visit new places when migrating."",

"Are people less happy or more happy the older they get ? A study found that people generally become happier and experience less worry after age 50. In fact, it found that by the age of 85, people are happier with their life than they were at 18.
The finding came from a Gallup survey of more than 340,000 adults in the United States in 2008. At that time, the people were between the age of 18 an 85.
Arthur Stone in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science at Stony Brook University in New York led the study. His team found that levels of stress were highest among adults between the ages of 22 and 25. Stress levels dropped sharply after people reached their fifties.
Happiness was highest among the youngest adults and those in their early seventies. But the people least likely to report feeling negative emotions  were those in their seventies and eighties. The survey also found that men and women had similar emotional patterns as they grow older. However, women at all ages reported more sadness, stress and worry than men did.
The researchers also considered possible influences like having young children, being unemployed or being single. But they found that influences like these did not affect the levels of happiness and well-being related to age.
So why would happiness increase with age ? One theory is that, as people get older, they become more thankful for what they have and have better control of their emotions. They also spend less time thinking about bad experiences.
The original  goal of the study was to confirm the popular belief that aging is connected with increased sleep problems. The survey did find an increase during middle age, especially in women. But except for that , people reported that they felt their sleep quality improved as they got older.","{

"Setting off fireworks  is usually a pleasure for many teenagers. Even though this is not legal in many areas, some will still find a way to get fireworks and have themselves a little celebration.
   You may know some teenagers that use fireworks in other manners, such as a try to set fire to buildings. This can result in some serious legal problems. Not only is it not legal to have the fireworks, but the teenagers will also be charged with the damage to buildings. You may think it's all fun, but it's dangerous for others as well as for your future.
   Setting off fireworks is dangerous especially when you don't know how to set off fireworks. Teenagers that don't know about the proper way to set off fireworks could end up in a lot of trouble. If something goes wrong, bodily harm can happen. It is possible for fireworks not to get off correctly and explode on the ground. If the teenager is too close, he could suffer some serious physical injuries.
   Teenagers can also cause a lot of harm to others who are in the same area as the fireworks. When teenagers do not know how to correctly deal with lighting fireworks, they will place a lot of people in harm's way. Many teenagers that were present for the fireworks show have been injured by a firework that was lit by another teenager.
   It is very common for teenagers with fireworks to set fire to nearby things, such as trees and buildings. This is why teenagers should always be supervised by an adult. Though they may seem fun and harmless, fireworks can actually cause a lot of damage if they are not dealt with correctly. It is common for teenagers to get into a lot of trouble for simply having fireworks, even if they are not caught setting them off. In addition to personal safety, the safety of surrounding things should always be considered.","{

"Our love of music and appreciation of musical harmony is learnt and not based on natural ability, a new study by University of Melbourne researchers has found. The researchers said previous theories about how we appreciate music were based on the physical functions of sound, the ear itself and a born ability to hear harmony.
The study shows that musical harmony can be learnt, and it is a matter of training the brain to hear the sounds. So if you thought that the music of some foreign culture (or Jazz) sounded like the crying of cats, it's simply because you haven't learnt to listen by their rules.
The researchers used 66 volunteers with a range of musical training and tested their ability to hear combinations of notes  to determine if they found the combinations familiar or pleasing. They found that people needed to be familiar with combinations of notes. If they found the notes unfamiliar they also found the sound unpleasant. This finding put an end to centuries of theories claiming that physical functions of the ear determine what we find attractive.
The study found that trained musicians were much more sensitive to unpleasant notes than non-musicians. When they couldn't find the note, the musicians reported that the sounds were unpleasant, while non-musicians were much less sensitive. This shows the importance of training or nurturing  the brain to like particular sound of combinations of notes, like those found in jazz or rock.
Depending on their training, a strange chord  sound was pleasant to some musicians, but very unpleasant to others. This showed us that even the ability to hear a musical note is learnt.
To confirm this finding, they trained 19 non-musicians to find the notes of a random selection of western chords. Not only did the participants' ability to hear notes improve rapidly, afterward they reported that the chords they had learnt sounded more pleasant -- regardless of how the chords were played.
The question of why some combinations of musical notes are heard as pleasant or unpleasant has long been debated. ""We have shown in this study that for music, beauty is in the brain of the beholder "", a researcher said.","{

"Skateboarding has become one of several non-traditional activities that PE teachers around America are introducing to inspire kids to exercise regularly. Some PE classes feature in-line  skating, yoga, and even rock climbing. Experts have called those types of activities ""the new PE"".
Such activities are part of a larger effort to help kids develop lifelong fitness habits and to keep them from becoming overweight. Now, 9 million U.S. children and teens are overweight. Obesity   can lead to health problems such as diabetes and heart disease later in life.
""Our children and youth are becoming unhealthy and obese,"" says Johnson. ""Skateboarding is a great activity that keeps kids doing physical movement and gives them new skills and interest.""
Some schools don't allow skateboarding because they say it is dangerous. Tim, however, argues that regular practice eliminates a great deal of the danger. ""We teach students how to do it and how to do it safely,"" he says.
Some people say skateboarding teaches life lessons. ""Skateboarding teaches kids to believe that if they stick with  something they will finally succeed."" says education expert Richard Savor from College in Portland.
Skateboarding encourages kids not to give up in learning difficult skills. ""It's natural for kids to want to learn and get better at things,"" adds Tim. ""When it comes to skateboarding, they'll try a trick hundreds of times before they succeed."" The same effort could be made in schoolwork.
Eric Brown agrees that skateboarding requires kids to stop saying a task is too hard for them. ""A baby will attempt to walk 600 to 900 times before he or she is successful,"" says Eric, ""We tell students that they shouldn't say 'I can't do it' unless they've tried 600 to 900 times.","{

"I've tried to explain compound interest to my eight - year - old daughter. When I have finished it, she summarizes back to me, ""So, you are saying if I put $ 100 in the bank, when I turn sixteen the bank will give me $ 200?"" She has already grasped more of the concept than I understood at her age, but she couldn't clearly understand that until she sees them in action.
One day I gave her a Ziploc bag with a handful of pennies and told her over the course of a week I wanted her to give me a penny a day. I would deposit the penny in "" The Bank of Dad"" and compound interest would begin to accumulate the day she deposited the penny. At the end of the week we would check her bank balance.
Each day my daughter handed over one penny at the breakfast table and I deposited it in her bank. I gave her a ""receipt"" for her deposit and explained that she needed to keep up with the receipts to see how much money she had added to her account. In an effort to make this a little more realistic, I deposited a penny from my own piggy bank every other day to give her an additional four pennies at the end of the week.

"In the course of working my way through school, I took many jobs I would rather forget. But none of these jobs was as terrible as my job in an apple plant . The work was hard; the pay was poor; and, most of all, the working conditions were terrible.
First of all, the job made huge demands on my strength. For ten hours a night, I took boxes that rolled down a metal track and piled them onto a truck. Each box contained twelve heavy bottles of apple juice. I once figured out that I was lifting an average of twelve tons of apple juice every night.
I would not have minded the difficulty of the work so much if the pay had not been so poor. I was paid the lowest wage of that time--two dollars an hour. Because of the low pay, I felt eager to get as much as possible. I usually worked twelve hours a night but did not take home much more than $ 100 a week.
But even more than the low pay, what made me unhappy were the working conditions. During work I was limited to two ten-minute breaks and an unpaid half hour for lunch. Most of my time was spent outside loading trucks with those heavy boxes in near-zero-degree temperatures. The steel floors of the trucks were like ice, which made my feet feel like stone. And after the production line shut down at night and most people left, I had to spend two hours alone cleaning the floor.
I stayed on the job for five months, all the while hating the difficulty of the work, the poor money, and the conditions under which I worked. By the time I left, I was determined never to go back there again.","{

"It remains a curiosity and a bit of a historical mystery why we don't all drive on the same side of the road. The fact is that most people are right-handed; that's why, for much of history, drivers have stuck to the left. Ancient Romans using two-wheeled carriages are believed to have held the reins  with their right hands and a whip with their left; to avoid whipping the near drivers, they favored the left-hand side the road. It's also easier for right-handers to get on a horse from the left, so riders were attracted to that side to avoid the near traffic as they climbed on and off. Finally, knights  and the other drivers favored the left so they could do battle, if necessary, with their good hand.
So why does most of the world travel on the right side today? Theories differ, but there's no doubt Napoleon was a major influence. The French have used the right since the late 18th century.  Some say that before the French Revolution, people in upper class drove their carriages on the left, forcing the _ to the right. During the violence, fearful rich people sought to mix with the peasantry by traveling on the right as well. Regardless of the origin, Napoleon brought right-hand traffic to the nations he conquered, including Russia, Switzerland and Germany. Hitler, in turn, ordered right-hand traffic in Czechoslovakia and Austria in the 1930s. Nations that escaped right-handed conquest, like Great Britain, kept their left-handed tradition.","{

On one level, we are not allowing our brain to admit that our weight problems lie not in actually losing the weight, but in controlling the consumption  of fatty, high-calorie, unhealthy foods. Diet products allow us to jump over the thinking stage and go straight for the scale  instead. All we have to do is to swallow  or recognize the word ""diet"" in food labels.
  On another level, diet products have greater psychological effects. Every time we have a zero-calorie drink, we are telling ourselves without our awareness that we don't have to work to get results. Diet products make people believe that  _ , and that life can be without resistance and struggle.
  The danger of diet products lies not only in the psychological effects they have on us, but also in the physical harm that they cause. Diet foods can indirectly harm our bodies because consuming them instead of healthy foods means we are preventing our bodies from having basic nutrients . Diet foods and diet pills contain zero calorie only because the diet industry has created chemicals to produce these wonder products. Diet products may not be nutritional, and the chemical that go into diet products are potentially dangerous.
  Now that we are aware of the effects that diet products have on us, it is time to seriously think about buying them. Losing weight lies in the power of minds, not in the power of chemicals. Once we realize this, we will be much better able to resist diet products, and therefore prevent the psychological harm that comes from using them .","{

"Lake Victoria is the largest lake in AfricA. It is also the second largest lake in the world. It is an important lake because it is one of the sources  for the longest river in the world, the Nile River.Lake Victoria provides a source of water, food, and power for several African countries.Lake Victoria is a big part of African life.
Unfortunately, Lake Victoria has a problem. _ .There are several power stations at Lake Victoria in Uganda. These are on the Nile River, and besides producing power, they keep the water of the lake at a certain level.For the past forty years, that level has been 11.9 meters.Over the last several years, the water level has dropped by about 2.5 meters.There seem to be several reasons for this drop.
One possible reason is drought .Drought has been very bad in the area since 2000.Lake Victoria gets all of its water from rain, so the drought means less water in the lake.
However, some environmentalists believe that the real problem is the power plants(factories) on Lake Victoria. Uganda depends on those power plants for most of its power, and they made the power plants larger in 2000.Many people believe the power plants have been taking too much water off Lake Victoria. As a result, they have been asked to use less water until Lake Victoria goes back to its old level.
Whether the low water level is caused by drought or power plants, the result is the same.This is already a poor area of Africa, where many people live a really hard life.People, animals and plants around Lake Victoria will suffer even more from low water levels on the lake.Many people need Lake Victoria for fishing or growing food. Fish need the water to live, and animals need it for water.Plants around the lake will die without the water, and then more animals and people will suffer.Unless the lake fills soon, many people will suffer and die.","{

"Are you ever so worried about something that you even have a headache or can't sleep at night? Do you ever feel a stomachache during a test? If so, then you know what stress is. Stress is what you feel when you are worried about something. When you are under stress, you may feel angry, sad, scared, or afraid --all this can give you a stomachache or a headache. In modern society, most people are under the higher stress than ever before.
There are different kinds of stress. Some kinds of stress are good and others are bad. Good stress may happen when someone asks you to answer questions in class or when you have to give a report. This kind of stress can help you to finish things better. Under this stress, you will find yourself have more motivation and energy to study.
However, bad stress can happen if the stress lasts too long. You may not feel well if a family member is sick, if you're having problems at school, or if anything else makes you upset every day. That kind of stress isn't going to help you.
The best way to keep stress away is to have a balanced life. If you get enough sleep and food, and if you exercise and leave time for fun, you'll feel less stress.","{

"As we all know, children are our future, and it's up to us to arm them with the tools to succeed. Sadly, today's children are sometimes being armed with more dangerous tools like weapons, drugs and gangs in the USA. Once a relatively peaceful environment, many schoolyards of today are becoming unsafe for both students and teachers.
Home schools are available to give you choices. Home schooling provides top-quality education, flexibility and freedom to create your own schedule. At Sunny Home School we believe the choice should be yours.
Thanks to modern technology, home schooling information is becoming readily available across the nation. A recent study by the ITBS (Iowa Tests of Basic Skills) and TAP (Tests of Achievement and Proficiency) shows us that students of home schools do particularly well when compared with the nationwide average. In every subject at every grade level, students of home schooling scored obviously higher than those in public and private schools.
If you're new to home schooling, you may be asking yourself, ""Will home schools really work for my children?""
Fact: A nationwide study using a random selection of 1,516 families found students of home schooling to be scoring, on average, at or above the 80thpercentile (80) in all areas, on standardized achievement test. (Note: The national average on standardized achievement test is the 50thpercentile.)
Collectively, the staff at Sunny Home School brings 65 years of experience in home schooling curriculum. We've placed students in the top 2% of the nation in math and many are successfully moving on to college.
One study found that of the home schooled students, 94% said home education prepared them to be independent persons.

"Two travelling angels stopped to spend the night in the home of a wealthy family. The family was impolite and refused to let the angels stay in the guest room. Instead the angels were given a space in the cold underground room. As they made their bed on the hard floor, the older angel saw a hole in the wall and repaired it. When the younger angel asked why, the older angel replied, ""Things aren't always what they seem.""
The next night the pair came to rest at the house of a very poor, but very kind farmer and his wife. After sharing what little food they had, the couple let the angels sleep in their bed where they could have a good night's rest. When the sun came up the next morning, the angels found the farmer and his wife in tears. Their only cow, whose milk had been their only income, lay dead in the field.
The younger angel was very angry and asked the older angel, ""How could this happen? Why did you not watch out for the cow? The first man had everything, yet you watched over his house,"" she accused. ""The second family had little but was willing to share everything, and you did not help.""
""Things aren't always what they seem,"" the older angel replied. ""When we stayed in the underground room , I noticed there was gold stored in that hole in the wall. Since the owner was so greedy and unwilling to share his good fortune, I asked God if I could seal the wall so he couldn't find it.

"Over the past century, all kinds of unfairness and discrimination have been made illegal. But one popular form continues to exist, that is alphabetism  . This, for those as yet unaware of such a disadvantage, refers to discrimination against those whose surnames begin with a letter in the lower half of the alphabet.
It has long been known that the cars of a taxi firm called AAAA have a big advantage over Zodiac cars when customers look through their phone directories. Less well known is the advantage that Adam Abbot has in life over Zoe Zysman. English names are fairly spread between the halves of the alphabet. Yet a quite large number of top people have surnames beginning with letters between A and K.
Thus the American presidents and vice-presidents have surnames starting with B and  C separately and 26 of those before George Bush took office (including his father ) had surnames in the first half of the alphabet against just 16 in the second half. Even more striking, six of the seven heads of government of the G7 rich countries are alphabetically advantaged (Berlusconi, Blair, Bush, Chirac, Chretien and Koizumi). The world's three top central bankers ( Greenspan, Duisenberg and Hayami)are all close to the top of the alphabet, even if one of them really uses Japanese characters. The same case are the world's five richest men ( Gates, Buffet and so on) .
Can this merely happen by chance? At the start of the first year in primary school, teachers seat pupils, alphabetically from the front, to make it easier to remember their names. So shortsighted and small-sized Zysman junior gets stuck in the back row, and is seldom asked the improving questions by those teachers. At that time the alphabetically disadvantaged may think they have had a lucky escape. Yet the result may be worse qualifications, because they get less attention, as well as less confidence in speaking publicly.
The unfairness continues. At university graduation parties, the ABCs proudly get their awards first. However, by the time they reach the Zysmans most people are a little tired. Lists of job interviews and conference speakers and attendees all tend to be drawn up alphabetically, and their readers lose interest as they plough through them.","{

"Who's in control of your life? Who's pulling your strings ? For the majority of us, it's other people--society, colleagues, friends, family or our religious community. We learned this way of operating when we were very young, of course. We were brainwashed. We discovered that feeling important and feeling accepted was a nice experience and so we learned to do everything we could to make other people like us. As Oscar Wilde puts it, ""Most people are other people. Their thoughts are someone else's opinions, their lives a mimicry , their passions a quotation.""
So when people tell us how wonderful we are, it makes us feel good. We long for this good feeling like a drug--we are addicted to it and seek it out wherever we can. Therefore, we are so eager for the approval of others that we live unhappy and limited lives, failing to do the things we really want to. Just as drug addicts and alcoholics live worsened lives to keep getting their fix , we worsen our own existence to get our own constant fix of approval.
But, just as with any drug, there is a price to pay. The price of the approval drug is freedom--the freedom to be ourselves. The truth is that we cannot control what other people think. People have their own agenda , and they come with their own baggage and, in the end, they're more interested in themselves than in you. Furthermore, if we try to live by the opinions of others, we will build our life on sinking sand. Everyone has a different way of thinking, and people change their opinions all the time. The person who tries to please everyone will only end up getting exhausted and probably pleasing no one in the process.
So how can we take back control? I think there's only one way--make a conscious decision to stop caring what other people think. We should guide ourselves by means of a set of values--not values imposed from the outside by others, but innate values which come from within. If we are driven by these values and not by the changing opinions and value systems of others, we will live a more authentic , effective, purposeful and happy life.","{

"Fido was now his master's constant companion in his walks, playing and skipping round him, and amusing him by a thousand sportive tricks . He took care, however, not to be troublesome by leaping on him with dirty paws, nor would he follow him into the parlor , unless invited. He also attempted to make himself useful by a number of little services. He would drive away the sparrows as they were stealing the chickens' meat; and would run and bark with the utmost fury at any strange pigs or other animals that offered to come into the yard. He kept the poultry, geese, and pigs from straying beyond their bounds and particularly from doing mischief in the garden. He was always ready to alarm Towzer if there was any suspicious noise about the house, day or night. If his master pulled off his coat in the field to help his workman, as he would sometimes do, Fido always sat by it, and would not suffer either man or beast to touch it. By this means he came to be considered as a very trusty protector of his master's property.
His master was once confined to his bed with a dangerous illness. Fido planted himself at the chamber-door, and could not be persuaded to leave it even to take food; and as soon as his master was so far recovered as to sit up, Fido, being admitted into the room, ran up to him with such marks of excessive joy and affection, as would have melted any heart to behold.
One hot day, after dinner, his master was sleeping in a summer-house , with Fido by his side. The building was old and crazy; the dog comprehended the danger, and began barking to awaken his master; and this not sufficing, he jumped up, and gently bit his finger. The master upon this started up, and had just time to get out of the door before the whole building fell down. Fido, who was behind, got hurt by some rubbish which fell upon him.

"Ever wondered how one person could save the planet from the effects of climate change?
A British-made computer game on trial release on Monday creates different ways of doing just that.
""Fate of the World""puts the Earth's future in players' hands, placing them in charge of an international environmental body which could save the world from the effects of rising greenhouse gas emissions or let it destroyed by more emissions.
Through different scenes, players can explore options such as geoengineering  and alternative energy sources to save the planet from rising temperatures, decreasing natural resources and a growing population over the next 200 years.
An improved version of the game will be followed by a three-month feedback period from players, with final release due in February next year.
Created by Oxford-based games developer Red Redemption, the game is different from other mainstream action games mainly by using data from real climate models and advice from scientists and economists.
""Science data is often inaccessible and we are trying to put players in a position of power and connected with the issues,"" Gobion Rowlands, Red Redemption's founder and chairman said.
This year, a series of apparent errors in climate science and the failure of UN talks to reach an international deal to cut greenhouse gas emissions appeared to weaken the public's interest in climate change.
However, games centered on sustainability and human rights have been growing in popularity and are welcomed by green groups as a way of raising awareness.
Using climate change as inspiration for entertainment shows the issue has affected global culture, which can only be a good thing.Friends of the Earth's head of climate Mike Childs said.""We need creative industries to work with these big issues as the results can be extremely powerful and can help us to understand what a sustainable future looks and feels like,""he added.","{

"This year, Face book, the social media website announced that it would cooperate with several news organizations -- including The New York Times, The Guardian, and the BBC -- to place news stories directly into users' personal Face book webpage. Stories published using Face book Instant will load more quickly and keep the style of the original publisher, who will keep all the advertising income the stories earn -- at least for now. The deal shows how important social media has become to news organizations, and is a clear sign of how the world of news is changing -- and has been for a while.
Many thought of it as the death of the newspaper, when Google News began in 2002. It had no human editor. Instead Google used, and still uses, a secret computer program that selects and displays news stories according to the reader's personal interests, More recently, Associated Press and Yahoo have been publishing computer-written articles. Both use special software to automatically produce stories about company financial results and sports reports -- areas where the quality of writing is felt to be of secondary importance to the accuracy of the data.
I think we should be concerned about such developments. One concern is that Facebook, Google and other social media websites see journalism as a sideline  , a way of putting people in front of advertisements. _ isn't their primary function -- so if it stops making them lots of money, they're likely to stop doing it.
There's another concern that computer-written articles are not actually journalism at all, because what a human news team produces is actually quite complex. A well-written news story puts information in context, offers a voice to each side of an argument and brings the public new knowledge.
Although economics and speed of delivery mean readers will probably choose a computer-written story over a carefully shaped article -- at least for daily news -- I don't think the computers will be writing any in-depth articles for a while yet.","{

"Scientists have not come close to understanding all the different kinds of life on the planet, but US researcher Craig Venter is already working on creating the first artificial life.
Venter and his researchers made a breakthrough this August. They successfully moved the DNA of one type of bacteria  to a yeast  cell, changed it, then put it into another bacterial cell.
""Bacteria have systems that protect them from foreign DNA,"" Venter explained to the BBC. In the experiment, the team managed to block this system.
The experiment was performed on a simple type of bacteria called Mycoplasma mycoides. The team took the bacteria's genes and put them into a yeast cell.
Putting the DNA in a yeast cell allowed the team to change the genes----in this case, taking out a gene that was not necessary for the bacteria to live.
They then put the gene into a host bacteria cell. The cell went on to divide normally, producing new healthy bacteria.
In January, the team created artificial genes of a new type of bacteria. Their next goal is to put the artificial DNA into a host cell to create a new species, according to a report inSciencemagazine.
""If we don't make any errors, I think it should work and we should have the first artificial species by the end of the year,"" Venter said in the report.
The first artificial life from is likely to be a simple man-made bacteria, to prove that the technology can work. But that form will be followed by more complex bacteria that turn coal into cleaner natural gas, or algae that can take in carbon dioxide and change it into fuel.

"Why is pink or purple a color for girls and blue or brown for boys?
The answer depends largely on cultural values as well as personal experiences. To the Egyptians, green was a color that represented the hope and joy of spring, while for Muslims, it means heaven. Red is a symbol of good luck in many cultures. In China, children are given money in a red envelope to bring good fortune in the New Year. For many nations, blue is a symbol of protection and religious beliefs. Greek people often wear a blue necklace hoping to protect themselves against evils .
People's choice of colors is also influenced by their bodies' reactions  toward them. Green is said to be the most restful color. It has the ability to reduce pain and relax people both mentally and physically. People who work in green environment have been found to have fewer stomach aches.
Red can cause a person's blood pressure to rise and increase people's appetites . Many decorators will include different shades of red in the restaurant. Similarly, many commercial websites will have a red ""Buy Now"" button because red is a color that easily catches a person's eye.
Blue is another calming color. Unlike red, blue can cause people to lose appetite. So if you want to eat less, some suggest that eating from blue plates can help.

Although early Bonfires were little more than piles of trash, as time passed, the annual event became more organized. Over the years the bonfire grew bigger, setting the world record in 1969. Bonfire remained a university tradition for decades until, in 1999, a collapse during construction killed twelve people--eleven students and one former student--and injured twenty-seven others.
The accident led Texas A&M to declare a pause on an official Bonfire. However, in 2002, a student-sponsored-and-off-campus ""Student Bonfire"" came up.
In 2003, the event became known as Student Bonfire. In a design approved by a professional engineer, Student Bonfire uses a wedding cake design, but, in a departure from tradition, every log in the stack   touches the ground. For added support, four 24 feet poles are spaced evenly around the stack and then bolted to the 45 feet center pole with a steel pipe. Since the group does not receive funding, Student Bonfire charges a fee to each attendee to cover expenses. Attendance for Student Bonfire ranges from 8,000-15,000 people and the event is held in Brazos County or one of the surrounding counties.","{

"Have you ever had this moment: you are talking about name? Don't worry! In English, there are special names to replace their real names.
In the US, if you forget someone's name, you can simply say the name John Doe for a man, or Jane Doe for a woman. For example, 'Did you see that boy who was running in the rain?' 'Ah, yes, poor John Doe.'
Also, in US courts ( ), people also use these names. This is to keep the person' s identity  a secret. People use the name so often that there was even a comedy film in 1941 called Meet John Doe.
However in the UK, unknown people are called John Smith. This is because John is one of the most common first names in English. And Smith is the most common family name.
So next time you forget someone's name, you know who to say.","{

"I'm Sam. My hobby is playing chess --one of the greatest games in the world. My mom taught me how to play when I was 7. She beat  me every time for the first year. But then on my eighth birthday, I won for the first time. I nearly always beat her from then on.
It takes about a day to learn the rules . But if you want to be good, you have to practice for years. You don't need much to play chess--just a chess set  and someone to play with.
Chess sets can be quite cheap, or very expensive. Some people collect chess sets as a hobby, but some prefer playing.
There is a chess club in our school, and we meet every week to play with each other. I'm the best player in the club, and the captain of the school chess team. This year we won the All English Schools' Championship , and I had to go up on stage  in front of the whole school to collect the trophy .
I'm saving up my money to buy a chess computer. It's very expensive, but very good for practice. In that way, I'll always have someone to play with. One day I will be the world chess champion .

"Farmers grow cocoa trees in the shady areas of rainforests near the Earth's equator. These trees can be difficult to grow. They require an exact amount of water, warmth, soil and protection. After about five years, cocoa trees start producing large fruits called pods. The seeds inside these pods are harvested to make chocolate.
Today we travel around the world exploring the history of chocolate. Its story begins with a plant whose scientific name, Theobroma cocoa, means ""food of the gods"". People have been enjoying the rich flavor of chocolate, a product made from this plant.
Most people know that chocolate is made from cocoa and that the origins of chocolate can be traced back to Central and South America. For centuries, the natives there regarded cocoa as a gift from the gods. But how did chocolate go from being the food of the gods to being the food of love?
Historians believe the Maya of Central America first learned to farm cocoa plants around two thousand years ago. The Maya took the cocoa trees from the rainforests and grew them in their gardens. They cooked the cocoa seeds, and then crushed them into a soft substance. They used the cocoa bean as the main part in a dark, bitter drink that we would call ""chocolate"". They believed that chocolate had mystical characteristics -- but cocoa also had commercial  value. In fact, cocoa beans were used as a form of currency that was worth its weight in gold!
The explorer Christopher Columbus brought cocoa seeds to Spain after his trip to Central America in 1502. But the Spanish explorer Conquistador Hernando Cortez was the first European explorer to realize cocoa's commercial possibilities. When he arrived in the New World in 1519, he soon established  his own cocoa plantation. In 1529, Cortez returned to Spain and introduced chocolate -- as a drink mixed with sugar, vanilla, and cinnamon -- to European society.
The wealthy people of Spain first enjoyed a sweetened type of the chocolate drink. Later, the popularity of the drink spread throughout Europe. The English, Dutch and French began to plant cocoa trees in their own colonies. Chocolate remained a drink that only wealthy people could afford to drink until the eighteenth century. During the period known as the Industrial Revolution, new technologies helped make chocolate less costly to produce.
It caught on -- especially with the noble people, who enjoyed hot chocolate as an aphrodisiac (a kind of medicine). As its popularity spread, people found new ways to make and use chocolate. These days, chocolate is enjoyed as both a tasty treat and a romantic indulgence everywhere.","{

"What would you do if you had an accident in your daily life?
It is important for you to get some knowledge about first aid in your daily life. If a person has an accident, he / she needs medical care before a doctor can be found. When you give first aid, you must know three things:
First, when a person stops breathing  , open his / her mouth to see if there is food in his / her mouth. Second, if a person cannot breathe, try to start his / her breathing at once, using a mouth-to-mouth way. Third, if a person is hurt badly, try to stop the bleeding   at once. And then take him / her to a doctor, because if a person loses one third of his / her blood, he / she may be in great danger.
Many accidents may happen at home, and everyone should know some first aid to deal with common injuries. When a person _ by an animal, wash the wound with cold running water before he / she is taken to see a doctor. When a person is burnt, wash and cool the area of the skin under the cold tap for a while, then put a piece of dry clean cloth over the burn. If a person is badly burnt, take him / her to the doctor.

"Teenagers with a bedroom television tend to have poorer diet and exercise habits and lower grades in school than those without one, US researchers said on Monday.
    While many studies have examined TV viewing habits of young people, researchers at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health said little had been known about the effects in particular for older teenagers of having a bedroom TV.
    They questioned 781 teenagers, aged 15 to 18, in the Minneapolis area in 2003 and 2004. Of them, 62 % reported having a television in their bedroom.
    Not surprisingly, those with a bedroom TV were more likely to watch it a lot, clocking four to five more hours in front of a television per week, the researchers said. Many more teens with a bedroom TV were classified as heavy TV watchers than those without one.
    Girls with a bedroom television reported getting less exercise -- 1.8 hours per week compared to 2.5 hours for girls without a TV. They also ate fewer vegetables, drank more sweetened drinks and ate meals with their family less often.
    Boys with a bedroom TV reported having a lower grade point average than boys without one, as well as eating less fruit and having fewer family meals.
    ""It is clearly important not to allow your child to have a TV in the bedroom,"" said Daheia Barr-Anderson, one of the researchers.
    ""When you upgrade your TV in the living room and you have this smaller TV that's out of date but still usable, you should really resist putting it in one of your children's bedrooms,"" she said in a telephone interview.","{

"Starting from this month, you won't be hearing the word ""NBA"" on sports programs on CCTV. Instead, sport hosts will give the full Chinese name when they refer to the NBA - National Basketball Association. You also won't hear any other English abbreviations on CCTV's Chinese programs, such as GDP (gross domestic product) or WTO (World Trade Organization). You will hear their Chinese translations.
CCTV received a notice from the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television, telling it to avoid using English-language abbreviations in their reports to protect the ""purity"" of the Chinese language. A few other TV stations also received the notice.
Fu Zhenguo, an editor of People's Daily, is one of the people who proposed the change. ""Using English in a Chinese-speaking environment is against Chinese law,"" he said. ""Using English on Chinese TV programs is unfair to people who don't understand English. It will have a bad language influence on kids and teenagers.""
But some experts have a different opinion. Liu Yaoying, a professor at the Communications University of China, said the move shows cultural conservatism . ""If Western countries can accept some Chinglish words, why can't the Chinese language be mixed with English?"" Liu said.
A lot of people have criticized the move, saying that it will cause problems for them.
""I understand what CD, VCD and DVD mean when I hear them. But I won't know what the TV programs are talking about if I hear those products' full Chinese names,"" a person wrote in a BBS post. Following the same post, another person wrote jokingly: ""I'm not listening to my MP3 now. I'm listening to my Moving Picture Experts Group-1 Audio Layer 3.

"Now let me tell you a story. It started two years ago, when I hit my head and got a concussion  . The concussion didn't heal properly, and after 30 days I was left with symptoms like nonstop headaches, sickness, memory loss, mental fog  . My doctor told me that in order to heal my brain, I had to rest it. So I had to avoid everything that caused my symptoms. For me that meant no reading, no writing, no video games, no work or e-mail, no running, no alcohol, no caffeine. In other words -- and I think you see where this is going -- no reason to live.
Of course it's meant to be funny, but to be honest, suicidal idea is quite common with traumatic   brain injuries. It happens to one in three, and it happened to me. My brain started telling me: ""Jane, you want to die."" It said: ""You're never going to get better."" It said: ""The pain will never end.""
And these voices became so persistent and so persuasive that I started to reasonably fear for my life, which is the time that I said to myself after 34 days -- and I will never forget this moment -- I said, I am either going to kill myself or I'm going to turn this into a game.
Now, why a game? I knew from researching the psychology of games for more than a decade that when we play a game -- and this is in the scientific works -- we deal with tough challenges with more creativity, more determination, more optimism, and we're more likely to reach out to others for help. And I wanted to bring these gamer characters to my real-life challenge, so I created a role-playing recovery game called Jane the Concussion Killer.
The game was that simple: adopt a secret identity, recruit   your allies  , battle the bad guys, activate the power-ups  . But even with a game so simple, within just a couple days of starting to play, that fog of depression and anxiety went away. It just vanished. It felt like a miracle. It wasn't a miracle cure for the headaches or the cognitive   symptoms. Those lasted for more than a
year, and it was the hardest year of my life by far. But even when I still had the symptoms, even while I was still in pain, I stopped suffering.
Now what happened next with the game surprised me. I put up some blog posts and videos online, explaining how to play. But not everybody has a concussion, obviously, not everyone wants to be ""the killer,"" so I renamed the game SuperBetter.","{

"When you have a question about something, where do you go? For many people the answer is simple as they can go online to a search engine like Google or Yahoo. But what about people in rural or underdeveloped areas who may have no way to get on the Internet?
   A business and international development professor in California, Rose Shuman, found an answer for them: Question Box. Question Box is a service that provides answers---free of charge---for people who cannot search the Internet directly. The users of Questions Box might be those who might not be able to read, or simply have no access to the Internet.
   Question Box began three years ago in India. People used a metal call box with a push-to-talk button to connect a live operator. Rose Schuman explained,"" You just need to push a big green button on the box which will connect you directly to our operators who are sitting in front of computers, and speak your language. You can ask them any sort of question you want, and they'll look it up in English or in Hindi, or whatever the main language is, and translate the answer back for you.""
   The service is currently offered in two villages. The latest version of the box uses mobile phone technology, and solar panels in case the electrical power fails. Rose Shuman says the aim was to make the box as easy as possible for users, ""It is very efficient  . Rather than try to bring a lot of difficulties to them and expect them to spend a lot of time to learn how to use the Internet, the idea was to make a technology that even Grandma could use.""
   In April 2009, Question Box was introduced to Uganda. Forty community workers with mobile phones connected villagers to call center operators in Kampala. The community workers went around telling people about the service. They wore T-shirts that said ""Ask me."" But Internet service in Uganda proved slow and undependable. So Question Box teamed up with a local technology company to store information on a local server. That way, the researchers in Kampala could quickly search the database for answers.","{

"Who needs guard dogs when you have wolves , right? That's probably what Kazakh villagers in the Almaty region though when they decided to replace their dogs with the fierce forest dwelling beasts. According to local news reports, taming  wolves is now the latest trend and a sort of hobby among rural Kazakhs.
Nurseit Zhylkyshybay, a farmer from the south-eastern Almaty region, told reporters that he purchased a wolf cub from hunters three years ago, and the animal is now perfectly tamed.
Kurtka, Nurseit's pet wolf, lives in the family's yard and takes long walks through the village with his master. ""He's never _ ,"" Nurseit insisted. ""I rarely put him on a chain and do take him for regular walks around the village. Our family and neighbors aren't scared of him at all.""
But wolf expert Almas Zhaparov said that the animals are 'far too dangerous' to keep at home. ""A wolf is like a ticking bomb, it can go off at any moment,"" he warned. ""If nothing is done, the fashion could spread to the wealthy Kazakhs, who might try to keep wolves in the grounds of their houses, with possibly deadly consequences."" Social media users also expressed worry about the trend, accusing the government for failing to limit the practice.
Nevertheless, the wolves don't seem to be posing an immediate threat. If visuals from news reports are anything to go by, the beasts look pretty happy with their new lifestyle, and appear quite fond of their new masters, not unlike dogs.","{

The water, it angrily argues in public, has traveled 10,000 "" _ "" before it reaches Western customers. ""Transporting water half-way across the world is surely the extremely stupid use of fuel when there is plenty of water in the UK."" It is also worried that we are wasting our fuel by buying prawns from Indonesia (7,000 food miles) and carrots from South Africa (5,900 food miles).
Counting the number of miles traveled by a product is a strange way of trying to tell the true situation of the environmental damage done by an industry. Most food is transported around the world on container ships that are extremely energy-efficient. It should be noted that a ton of butter transported 25 miles in a truck to a farmers' market does not necessarily use less fuel on its journey than a similar product transported hundreds of miles by sea, Besides, the idea of ""food miles"" ignores the amount of fuel used in the production. It is possible to cut down your food miles by buying tomatoes grown in Britain rather than those grown in Ghana; the difference is that the British ones will have been raised in heated greenhouses and the Ghanaian ones in the open sun.
What is the idea of ""food miles"" does provide, however, is the chance to cut out Third World countries from First World food markets. The number of miles traveled by our food should, as I see it, be regarded as a sign of the success of the global trade system, not a sign of damage to the environment.","{

"Many animal and plant species have become extinct and many more are in critical danger. Finding ways to protect the earth's wildlife and conserve the natural world they inhabit is now more important than ever. 
Dodo
The Dodo is a classic example of how human caused damage to the earth's biology. The flightless Dodo was native to the Island of Mauritius in the Indian Ocean. It lived off fruit fallen from the island's trees and lived unthreatened until humans arrived in 1505. The easily controlled bird became a source of food for sailors and was attacked by animals introduced to the island by humans such as pigs, monkeys and rats. The population of Dodos rapidly decreased and last one was killed in 1681. 
Rhinos
The Rhino horn is a highly priced item for Asian medicine. This has led to the animal being hunted in its natural habitat. Once widespread in Africa and Eurasia, most rhinos now live in protected natural parks and reserves . Their numbers have rapidly decreased in the last 50 years, and the animals remain under constant threat from poachers . 
The Giant Panda
The future of the World Wildlife Fund's symbol is far from certain. As few as 1000 remain in the wild. The Chinese government has set up 33 panda reserves to protect these beautiful animals and made poaching them punishable with 20 years in prison. However, The panda's distinct black and white patched coat fetches a high price on the black market and determined poachers still pose one of the most serious threats to the animals continued existence. 
Whales
The International Whaling Commission is fighting to ensure the survival of the whale species. Despite the fact that one-third the world's oceans have been declared whale sanctuaries , 7 out of 13 whale species remain endangered. Hunted for their rich supply of oil, their numbers have decreased to just 300. Collisions with ships, poisonous pollution and being caught in fishing nets are other major causes of whale deaths. 
Tigers
The last 100 years has seen a 95% reduction in the numbers of remaining tigers to between 5000 and 7000 and the Bali, Javan, and Caspian tigers are already extinct. The South China tiger is precariously close to disappearing, with only 20 to 30 still alive. Like the Rhino horn, tigers' bones and organs are sought after for traditional Chinese medicines. These items are traded illegally along with tiger skins.","{

"Ask anyone what is the most difficult part of changing their lifestyle habits and they are most likely to say, ""Staying motivated."" But a 36-year-old professor from Carnegie Mellon University claims it may have the answer in the form of robot weight loss coach that dishes out daily health advice and encouragement.
Autom is the work of Intuitive Automata, a company based in Sha Tin which claims to be a pioneer in commercial socially-interactive robots.
The robot, which stands around 38 centimeters tall, has a head that swivels  , blue eyes, and a touch screen which allows the user to input information daily about exercise and diet Its creators say Autom will have a daily conversation with its user lasting up to five minutes, giving feedback and encouragement.Over time, it will interact more with the user as it gathers more information about them.
Cory Krdd, a research team manager with the Federal Emergency Management Agency claims research has shown that people find robots a more reliable source of information than on-screen-based character.
In a controlled study in Pittsburgh City Council, 15 dieters were given Autom for six weeks. Another 15 received a touch-screen computer with identical software and 15 were given a paper log.The study found, people using the robot are more likely to stick with their diets longer, in fact twice as long as those using just a paper log.
""While not one person among the computer or paper groups continued past six weeks, most who had Autom did not want to give her back at the conclusion of the study,"" he said.
The bottom line is that a robot creates a more powerful and long-lasting relationship with the user than a character on the screen.
Autom is expected to go on sale later this year in the United States for around $500.A robot which speaks and understands Cantonese and Mandarin in addition to English according to the demands is also being developed.","{

"Today the word friendship has been used so often that it has lost its meaning. Some jokingly or seriously say that friends are made to be used. It makes me very sad.
True friendship doesn't mean that when you need your friend's help,you will treat him to dinner,and when you have to protect yourself,you will put your friends in a difficult situation.
In fact,true friendship is the communication and understanding of the hearts .
True friendship is like water. Compared wish decent wine,water is tasteless,but is of great help when we are thirsty. True friends don't need to be with each other every day,but are connected in heart every minute.
True friendship is like medicine. Though it is bitter,it cures your illness. True friends give you some suggestions even if they know you would not take. They criticize you when others have a good word for you,not because of envy but worrying that you may lose your cool head.
True friendship has nothing to do with fame,power or money. True friends would often watch you silently far away when you are _ ,but come to you whenever you need their help. You're not his stepping-stone to success,but are his crutch to live through difficulties.
True friends make you complete. Many persons go along with you through your life-your parents,your spouse,and your children,who take care of you and make your life happy. However,you still need someone who understands your thoughts and souls. Without them,you are likely to be unhealthy in spirit.
True friends stay in your heart,rather than at your side;they know you more than yourself,and try to better you.
Once you have found such a true friend,do treasure him. If your true friend disappears,how can you make the sound of your heart understood?","{

"If a snake bites you, take a photo with your mobile phone! It save your life. This is the surprising advice of a British cook. One day Henry Jackson was working in a restaurant kitchen. He picked up a dish from a table, and suddenly a snake appeared and bit him on the hand. A few days earlier, the snake came to the restaurant from Asia in a box of bananas. It climbed out of the box and hid under the dish. "" I tried to pick it up and it bit me. I threw it away, but it landed in the fridge. So I closed the door."" Jackson said. Anyway, Jackson was cool and he took a photo of the snake with his mobile phone. Soon his hand began to ache and he went to hospital. Then his chest began to hurt. Doctors couldn't say what was wrong because they didn't know what kind of snake it was.
Then Jackson remembered his mobile phone photo. The doctors sent it to London Zoo. When they knew the kind of snake, they could give Jackson the right medicine, and he left hospital the next day. "" So my advice is this: If a snake bits you, pick up your phone. Take its photo first and then call the hospital. Show the photo to the doctors,"" suggests Mr. Jackson.

"We've talked about snails   and their slow move. But much of the time snails don't move at all. They're in their shells ---sleeping .
Hot sun will dry out a snail's body. So at the least sign of hot sun, a snail draws its body into its shell and closes the opening with a thin cover. Then it goes to sleep. A snail will die in a heavy rain. So whenever it rains, it goes inside its shell house and goes to sleep. A snail can sleep for as long as it needs to. It can take a short sleep. Or it can sleep for days at a time. And it spends all the winter months in its shell, asleep.
In spring the snail wakes up. Its body, about three inches long, comes out of from the shell. When hungry, the snail looks for food. It can't see very well. Its eyes, at the ends of the top feelers are very weak. But its sense of smell is very strong. It helps the snail to the new greens. Then the snail's little mouth goes to work.
A snail's mouth is no longer than the point of a pin . Yet it has 256,000 teeth! The teeth are so small that you can't see them. But they do their work.. If you put a snail in a hard paper box, it will eat its way out. And if a snail wears out its teeth, it will grow new ones.

"Construction workers in Southern California have made a wild discovery. They were digging at a building site in San Timoteo Canyon   when they unearthed hundreds of ancient animal fossils. Researchers say the bones hold important clues about the history of the region.
Nearly 1, 500 fossils were recovered from the dusty canyon. The remains are about 1.4 million years old. They include the bones of a new species of deer, several small rodents   and more. A giant cat fossil was also found. Scientists believe the animal was an ancestor of the saber- toothed tiger. Signs of plant life were uncovered as well.
""This is a huge find,"" says Rick Greenwood, a scientist studying the site. ""I don't think most people had any idea that those types of animals were wandering around here more than a million years ago.""
San Timoteo Canyon is located about 85 miles from Los Angeles. The area of the canyon where the fossils were found was once part of a green river valley. Today, the region is dry and plant life is rare.
Most of the fossils are well preserved. Experts say a muddy lake bed may have trapped thirty animals that wandered over for a drink. The mud helped to protect the animal fossils.
The remains are a million years older than those discovered at the famous La Brea Tar Pits in Los Angeles. Scientists studying the bones will be able to learn more about how the animals adapted to changes in the environment.
""We have a confused view of what this time period was like, "" says another scientist. ""A discovery like this could really be an important contribution.""
About 35 different animal species are represented in the fossil collection. Scientists began removing bones from the site last fall. The project was completed this summer. Starting next year, the fossils will be on display at the Western Science Center in the nearby city of Hemet, California.","{

"As early as 1894, the newly-formed International Olympic Committee (IOC) considered ice skating as a possibility for the first modern Olympic Games which would be held in 1896.
In 1911, a member of the IOC suggested that winter sports should be staged as part of the 1912 Olympics in Helsinki. Some were against the idea. At last, the IOC decided to hold Winter Olympic Games in 1916. However, World War I broke out in 1914. After 1920, the national governing bodies for winter sports in several countries began talking about the possibility of a separate Winter Olympics.
The town of Chamonix, in the French Alps, planned to hold a winter sports festival in 1924, at the same time Paris was to host the Olympics. The Marquis de Polignac, a member of the IOC, suggested that the festival be formally recognized as the Winter Olympic Games. The IOC didn't go that far, but did agree that Chamonix could call its festival an ""Olympic winter carnival"".
The festival drew 258 athletes from 16 countries to compete in bobsledding , figure skating, hockey, Nordic skiing and speed skating. Charles Jewtraw from the United States won the first gold medal, in the 500-meter speed skating, but the festival's hero was Claus Thunberg from Finland. He won five medals, three of which were gold, in speed skating.
Weather has often been a major story at the Winter Olympics, and so it was at Chamonix. The festival opened with rain and unseasonably warm temperature that turned snow and ice to mud. Then temperature dropped as far as 25 below zero and the mud became ice.
Despite  the weather, more than 10,000 people showed up. At its yearly meeting in 1925, the IOC recognized the Chamonix festival as the first Winter Olympics and decided that the Winter Games would be held every four years, just like the Summer Olympics.","{

"New rules and behavior standards for the middle school students came out. Middle schools are going to use a new way to decide who the top students are. The following are some of the new rules.
You should not be allowed to dye your hair, smoke or drink. You should not copy others' work in an exam. Don't do it again if you did it!
Good students love animals and care for other people. Being kind to animals is being kind to ourselves. Be friendly to the people around you. Try to think of others, not only yourself.
Don't look down on new ideas. Everyone's ideas are important. You should welcome them, because new ideas make life better for everyone.
Learn to protect yourselves. If you have to go home late, you should let your mother or your father know.

"There is a very special wolf that lives in Africa. They are actually called, the African wild dog, of painted dogs.
These animals live in open woodlands, or in the plains of Africa. Today, however, most of the animals can be found in eastern or southern Africa. These animals are beautiful. They have rounded ears instead of pointed like most dogs, and they have four toes   on each of their four feet, also a unique characteristic because other dogs have five. Their fine fur is always different from each other. The fur is usually a combination of black, brown, red, and white, and sometimes even yellow. No wonder they're called the painted wolf.
The African wild dog is a very social animal. They live in groups and have numbers from five to about twenty. The members of a group are always very close to one another. They communicate in their own language or body language. When someone is very old or sick, the others will help, and they are willing to share the food with the elders and with those who are weak, which is what we should learn from.
The family does everything together, from raising young, to sleeping together, to hunting. When they hunt, they will work together suing team work to kill animals that are larger than them.
They sometimes hunt farm animals. This is unfortunate, because both poachers  , and people who own farms shoot the painted dogs who are just trying to survive.
Before, there used to be many large groups throughout the land, but now the African wild god is very rare. They are also losing their population because of their own loss of habitat thanks to human's farming and forest cutting.","{

"Dear Malia and Sasha,
    I know that you've both had a lot of fun these last two years on the campaign trail  , going to picnics and parades and state fairs, eating all sorts of junk food your mother and I probably shouldn't have let you have. But I also know that it hasn't always been easy for you and Mom, and that though you both are excited about that new puppy , it doesn't make up for all the time we've been apart. I know how much I've missed these past two years, and today I want to tell you a little more about why I decided to take our family on this journey. 
   When I was a young man, I thought life was all about me--about how I'd make my way in the world, become successful, and get the things I want. But then the two of you came into my world with all your smiles that never fail to fill my heart and light up my day. And suddenly, all my big plans for myself didn't seem so important anymore. I soon found that the greatest joy in my life was the joy I saw in yours. And I realized that my own life wouldn't be so important unless I was able to ensure that you had every opportunity for happiness and fulfillment in yours. In the end, girls, that's why I ran for President: because of what I want for you and for every child in this nation.   
   I want all our children to go to schools worthy of their potential --schools that challenge them, inspire them, and teach them a sense of wonder about the world around them. I want them to have the chance to go to college--even if their parents aren't rich. And I want them to get good jobs: jobs that pay well and give them benefits like health care, jobs that let them spend time with their own kids and retire with dignity .   
   I want us to push the boundaries of discovery so that you'll live to see new technologies and inventions  that improve our lives and make our planet cleaner and safer. And I want us to push our own human boundaries to reach beyond the divides of race and gender that keep us from seeing the best in each other.

OVERVIEW
This book offers straightforward practical answers when you need fast results. By working through each 10-minute lesson, you'll learn what you need to begin to use the PHP scripting language to make your websites interactive and dynamic.
REVIEW
When I first laid eyes on this book and its title, Teach Yourself PHP in 10 minutes, my first thought was that I was going to see this!  So I opened it up and figured I'd look through it for ten minutes and see what would hit me. Well, 10 minutes turned into 20, 20 into 30 and 30 into a valuable resource that sits on my desk.
Not only are the lessons within brief, but they are very easy to understand, well presented and very easy to understand for the beginner. Each lesson comes with tips to point out shortcuts, cautions to help you avoid common mistakes and notes to additional infomation. This book can be used in two ways, as a reference or as a complete tutorial on PHP basics. That alone is something that is very rare in teaching type books these days.
Some of the more valuable and informative lessons will take you into the areas of:
--Strings and variables
--Processing HTML forms
--Controlling and filtering data
--User authentication
--Cookies and sessions
--Security practices
--Configuring PHP and more!!!
The book is pretty basic for experienced PHP coders, but for new or intermediate users this book is worth more than the small $19.99 CAN suggested price. Although the cover suggests it covers PHP 5.0, the coding found within also applies to PHP 4.X
CONCLUSION
This book completely surprised me with its value and does indeed teach you in ten minutes what other books claim to do in 24 hours. Full marks to author Chris Newman for this handy guide.","{

"If you want to get the most out of the study of a language, you must also read for pleasure: novels, plays, travel books, and so on. And in reading books of this kind the important thing is _ ; to try to grasp  what the writer is going to tell you in the book as a whole. This is impossible if you stop and think over the meaning of every single word which happens to be unfamiliar.

When you are reading books of this kind, therefore, you will usually have to depend mainly on the context   to help you. If you meet an unfamiliar word, do not let it take too much of your attention from the main idea of the story.

"On the way home from school, Jack always passes a park. His mother said it was dangerous to pass by the park at night, but it is the fastest way home. Today, after finishing soccer practice, Jack was walking toward the park as usual.
Suddenly, Jack heard someone calling him, ""Excuse me!"" Jack turned around, and there was an old woman. ""Yes, ma'am."" Jack answered politely. ""Don't pass by the park tonight."" Her voice was weak and dry. ""Okay, ma'am,"" said Jack carelessly. The old woman held Jack's hand strongly, and said, ""I mean it!"" Jack felt the hairs on his neck stand up. As soon as the lady let go of his hand, he started to run. This time, he ran so fast that he didn't have time to think where he was going.

"People around the world are superstitious about numbers; even those ancient Greeks believed that all numbers and their multiples had some mystical significance.
Those numbers between 1 and 13 were in particular to have a powerful influence over the affairs of men.
For example, _ . The arrival of a letter will be followed by two others within a certain period.
Another belief involving the number three has it that it is unlucky to light three cigarettes from the one match. If this happens, the bad luck that goes with the deed falls upon the person whose cigarette was the last to be lit. The ill-men linked to the lighting of three things from one match or candle goes back to at least the 17th century and probably earlier. It was believed that three candles alight at the same time would be sure to bring bad luck; one, two, or four, were permissible, but never just three.
Seven was another significant number, usually regarded as a bringer of good luck. The ancient astrologers believed that the universe was governed by seven planets; students of Shakespeare will recall that the life of man was divided into seven ages. Seven horseshoes nailed to a house will protect it from all evil.
Nine is usually thought of as a lucky number because it is the product of three times three. It was much used by the Anglo Saxons in their charms for healing.
Another belief was that great changes occurred every 7th and 9th of a man's life. Consequently, the age of 63 (the product of nine and seven) was thought to be a very _ time for him. If he survived his 63rd year he might hope to live to a ripe old age.
Thirteen, as we well know, is regarded with great awe and fear. The common belief is that this derives from the fact that there were 13 people at Christ's Last Supper. This being the eve of his betrayal, it is not difficult to understand the significance given to the number by the early Christians.
In more modern times 13 is an especially unlucky number of a dinner party, for example. Hotels will avoid numbering a floor the 13th; the progression is from 12 to 14, and no room is given the number 13. Many home owners will use 12 1/2 instead of 13 as their house number.
Yet oddly enough, to be born on the 13th of the month is not regarded with any fear at all, which just shows how irrational we are in our superstitious beliefs.","{

"There's nothing like a good night's sleep -- but what does that really mean? It turns out that the answer depends not only on your age, but also on your lifestyle. Some people are productive and happy with fewer hours of sleep, while others need more. Still, experts can determine guidelines that work for most people. The National Sleep Foundation researched the topic and gave new recommendations this week. The foundation acknowledges that sleep needs will vary -- lifestyle and stress should be taken into consideration -- but their recommendations offer a general guideline. For example, teenagers (14 --17 years old) need 8--10 hours' sleep every day.
To create the recommendations, some sleep and medical experts reviewed 312 articles from journals published during the last decade. This is the first time that any professional organization has developed age-specific recommended sleep durations based on a systematic review of the world scientific literature.
A lack of sleep can be linked to weight gain, because that causes an increase in appetite, according to the foundation. It can also have serious consequences on the brain. People who do not get enough sleep are at increased risk for depression, and can endanger others. Those that become sleepy while driving, for example, risk both their lives and the lives of those around them.
Researchers also have found in the past that too much sleep can have negative effects. Low socioeconomic status and depression reportedly are significantly associated with longer sleep. However, experts nowadays find that research on oversleeping is still unconvincing and needs more attention. Currently, there is no strong evidence that sleeping too much has health consequences. There is, however, laboratory evidence that short sleep durations of four to five hours have negative consequences. We need similar laboratory studies to determine whether long sleep durations result in physiological changes that could lead to disease before we make any recommendations against sleep extension.","{

"Everybody is familiar with Christmas music; its played everywhere. Whether it's the music from a grocery store or random songs on the radio, holiday music remains to flood in the air from the day after Thanksgiving to the beginning of December. Christmas music gets extremely over- played through the Holiday season. ""'I think the common seasonal Christmas music is annoying because it keeps being played over and over.""said junior Devin McFarland.
The Christmas music still played today is what she heard in her childhood. Some famous Christmas songs have never been changed. The original music is played so much that in some cases people dream about or even sing Christmas music in their sleep. She wishes that there was a wider variety of songs. She likes the newer Christmas songs that bands either re- make or write themselves. ""They have a fresher sound to Christmas songs, and they add their own characteristics to them so that they are more like their own songs. "" McFarland explained.
Christmas is known as a happy and homecoming festival, so the holiday season is meant to be spent happily with your family. It is recognized that the music media wants to get the point across and add to the festival atmosphere. But isn't the music being pushed to the public too much?
Most grocery stores play the music non-stop ,Christmas song after Christmas song, disgusting the customers who don't like that kind of music. You can walk through stores and attempt turning off the music, but sometimes it's impossible to do so. On the other hand, almost everyone has witnessed random persons walking along happily and either singing or whistling to the tune of the song that's played throughout the store.","{

"I heard many parents complaining that their teenage children are rebelling. I wish it were so. At your age you ought to be growing away from your parents. You should be learning to stand on your own two feet. But take a good look at the present rebellion. It seems that teenagers are taking the same way of showing that they disagree with their parents. Instead of striking out boldly on their own, most of them are clutching   at one another's hands for reassurance.
They claim they want to dress as they please. But they all wear the same clothes. They set off in new directions in music. But somehow they all end up huddled   round listening to the same record. Their reason for thinking or acting in thus-and-such a way is that the crowd is doing it. They have come out of their cocoon   into a larger cocoon.
It has become harder and harder for a teenager to stand up against the popularity wave and to go his or her own way. Industry has firmly carved out a teenage market. These days every teenager can learn from the advertisements what a teenager should have and be. And many of today's parents have come to award high marks for the popularity of their children. All this adds up to a great barrier for the teenager who wants to find his or her own path.
But the barrier is worth climbing over. The path is worth following. You may want to listen to classical music instead of going to a party. You may want to collect rocks when everyone else is collecting records. You may have some thoughts that you don't care to share at once with your classmates. Well, go to it. Find yourself. Be yourself. Popularity will come -- with the people who respect you for who you are. That is the only kind of popularity that really counts.","{

"This Monday,the nation will start to celebrate Presidents' Day,just seven days before George Washington's birthday.Everyone agrees that day is a holiday,but is it just to celebrate George Washington's Birthday? What about Abraham Lincoln? Some government offices call it Presidents' Day.Others say the holiday is officially Washington's Birthday.Confused yet?
George Washington was elected the country's first President on April 30,1789.Soon after,Americans began publicly celebrating his birthday.Presidential historians say the actual date of George Washington's birth is February 11,1732.But a change in the calendar system 20 years later shifted all dates,making Washington's birthday February 22,which is now well accepted.In 1879.Congress made Washington's birthday an official federal holiday.It was the first federal holiday to celebrate an individual's birthday.In 1968,Congress passed the Monday Holidays Act,which moved the holiday to the third Monday in February.The new law did not change the holiday's name.It was still called Washington's Birthday,even though some lawmakers wanted to call it Presidents' Day to include Abraham Lincoln,whose actual birthday is February 12.
Many people argue that the holiday should celebrate all past Presidents.They feel Lincoln should be honored for his role in preserving the nation during the Civil War and helping to free slaves.Others feel the holiday should only honor Washington.the country's first President.They say shifting the focus away from Washington would mean future generations of kids would not know about the Father of Our Country.
Laws have been introduced in Congress over the years to require use of the term ""George Washington's Birthday.""but none of those laws have been passed.Meanwhile,many state governments and school districts now use the term ""Presidents' Day.""Many stoles also use it to promote holiday sales.
Should the holiday honor Washington,Washington and Lincoln,or all past Presidents? Write to emailbag@timeforkids.com and tell us what you think.","{

"For Chinese students the end of their senior year is filled with studying and stress as they prepare for the college entrance exams in June.
The end of senior year is a celebration of their time in high school and involves parties, games and fun.
Senioritis  is a commonly used expression. It means seniors have a disease which makes them unable to do work. This starts in April when seniors find out whether they have been accepted to university.
Unwilling to do school work, seniors have plenty of other activities to focus on.Many schools have a ""Senior Show"", in which only seniors are allowed to perform. Some seniors sing or dance but many of them perform skits  , where they make fun of their favorite teachers or their friends. For example, a group of boys may dress up and imitate  a group of their girl friends. It is all very light-hearted.The ""Senior Show"" is usually a part of Senior Week, which is a week specifically dedicated   to seniors. During this week, seniors usually get academic or athletic awards they have won over their high school careers. The seniors also vote for one of their male and female classmates who they believe is the best-looking or funniest or most involved, etc. These are then published in the yearbook.
The yearbook is an important part of high school for seniors. It is usually dedicated to them and has all their pictures and some words from them in it. Then seniors go around and get it signed by their friends so they can always remember their time together.
Of course during all of this time, seniors are preparing for the Senior Prom , which is an important moment in American culture. It is the most important dance in a young American's life.
The end of senior year is a truly special and wonderful time for American students. It's something they will remember for the rest of their lives.","{

"A recent report says we spend an average of two hours and 40 minutes each day looking at a smartphone. That doesn't mean making calls, but using apps and browsing the Web.
Spend that amount of time staring at anything. Checked our email in a restaurant, shared a picture of the food when it arrived, or checked a fact during a conversation only to be drawn into reading more instead of contributing verbally.  It's no secret our lives are being affected by our obsession with smartphones.
However, never before has this phenomenon been displayed so vividly as in the short YouTube film I Forgot My Phone. Despite only being online for a few days, it's already been viewed more than 10. 5 million times.
Ironically, YouTube's statistics show that the site gets a billion views per day from mobile devices, so a lot of those people watched it on their phone. 
The short film, written by and starring actress Charlene deGuzrnan, shows groups of people in various social situations, the majority of which are completely attracted by their phones instead of the world around them.

"Most people agree that honesty is a good thing. But does Mother Nature agree? Animals can't talk, but can they lie in other ways? Can they lie with their bodies and behavior?
Animal experts may not call it lying, but they do agree that many animals, from birds to chimpanzees, behave dishonestly to fool other animals. Why? Dishonesty often helps them survive.
Many kinds of birds are very successful at fooling other animals. For example, a bird called the plover sometimes pretends to be hurt in order to protect its young. When a predator   gets close to its nest, the plover leads the predator away from the nest. How? It pretends to have a broken wing. The predator follows the ""hurt"" adult, leaving the baby birds safe in the nest.
Another kind of bird, the scrub jay, buries its food so it always has something to eat. Scrub  jays are also thieves. They watch where others bury their food and steal it. But clever scrub jays seem to know when a thief is watching them. So they go back later, unbury the food, and bury it again somewhere else.
Birds called cuckoos have found a way to have babies without doing much work. How? They don't make nests. Instead, they get into other birds' nests secretly. Then they lay their eggs and fly away. When the baby birds come out, their adoptive parents feed them.
 _ After a fight, the losing chimp will give its hand to the other. When the winning chimp puts out its hand, too, the chimps are friendly again. But an animal expert once saw a losing chimp take the winner's hand and start fighting again.
Chimps are sneaky in other ways, too. When chimps find food that they love, such as
bananas, it is natural for them to cry out. Then other chimps come running. But some clever chimps learn to cry very softly when they find food. That way, other chimps don't hear them, and they don't need to share their food.
As children, many of us learn the saying ""You can't fool Mother Nature."" But maybe you can't trust her, either.","{

"Many people who work in London prefer to live outside it, and to go in to their offices or schools every day by train, car or bus, even though this means they have to get up early in the morning and reach home late in the evening.
One advantage of living outside London is that houses are cheaper. Even a small flat in London without a garden costs quite a lot to rent. With the same money, one can get a little house in the country with a garden of one's own.
Then, in the country one can rest from the noise and hurry of the town. Even though one has to get up earlier and spend more time in trains or buses, one can sleep better at night and during weekends and on summer evenings, one can enjoy the fresh, clean air of the country. If one likes gardens, one can spend one's free time digging, planting, watering and doing other jobs which are needed in a garden. Then, when the flowers and vegetables come up, one has the reward of one who has shared the secret of Nature.
Some people, however, take no interest in country things: for them, happiness lies in the town, with its cinemas and theatres, beautiful shops and busy streets, dance-halls and restaurants. Such people would feel that their life was not worth living if they had to live it outside London.

"In order to increase their job chances after college, Chinese students are turning to a special practice--Eiffel Tower nose jobs  . The latest trend in plastic surgery promises to create a nose that is similar to the curve of the Eiffel Tower.
Surgeon Wang Xuming said: ""We are influenced by the beauty of the Eiffel Tower. We are not content to just add something to the nose; we reconstruct it."" The surgery costs about US$ 10,000 and involves the enlarging of the nose using tissue from the forehead.
Hundreds of posters advertising the procedure are put up all over Chongqing city, where surgeon Xuming runs his private practice. They show a western-looking woman with an almost-too-perfect nose, against an outline of the Eiffel Tower.
Interestingly, many young women in China are eager to achieve a western appearance, as they believe it will give them an advantage in the highly competitive job market. ""Some students face a lot of employment pressure after graduation. If their facial features are good, they'll have more chances of finding a job,"" said surgeon Xuming. ""We've had students getting the Eiffel Tower nose; it's helped them a lot.""

Plastic surgeons across the country are reporting an increase in the number of students choosing beauty ""improvement"".

""We are not sure of the data yet, but we believe if people have short hair they do not need to use their hairdryers for so long and they will use less water. If all our staff do this, then it may save a lot of power.""
There is another advantage for employees of the construction firm, Ms. Inoue added, as it is easier to make short hair neat again after staff had been wearing hard hats. She said a lot of staff had been calling for information on where they can get their hair cut in the correct style.
Following the Fukushima nuclear disaster in March, Japan has been struggling to produce enough electricity for the tsunami ended production at the Fukushima plant. The disaster resulted in a review of the country's energy policy that now means less than a quarter of its remaining nuclear plants are in use. The government has talked about a move away from nuclear energy towards more sustainable   technologies. Many government institutions have taken measures to save power, including a reduced use of air-conditioning in offices and schools.","{

"Throughout life,change is the only thing that seems constant.Change has come to my 1ife many ways,in myself,and in my surroundings.At the same time,some things stay the same.This is when traditions are formed.I am often reminded of this by the photograph that sits by my bed.
It all began with a kiss on my very first day of school.I remember dancing around the mirror,watching as my dark blue dress created a teacup around my waist.I admired the little ruffle of my shirt collar and how it matched perfectly with the trim at the bottom of my dress.I knew I would be the envy of all my classmates.
    But somehow,something was missing.I reached under my bed for the large box of bows ,in every color1 imaginable,that I was famous for.I picked out a white one that would match my shirt and carefully ran to my mom.She fastened the finishing touch to my short brown hair and I was ready for my very first day of school.
    After admiring myself in the mirror,I heard my mom yell,""picture time!"" I dashed downstairs where my mum led to the spot.I  ly loved getting my picture taken.
After several individual shots and some with my older sister,Katherine,my dad came for a picture with us together.As I climbed onto my dad's lap,he wrapped his arms around Katherine and me and we both leaned in to kiss him on the cheek.At that moment,mum snapped the shot and our tradition began.
From them on,every year when the first day of school rolled around,we continued our tradition of pictures in the yard.The picture grew with my family;when my two younger sisters began school,our tradition expanded from 15 minutes to 45.The mass chaos was directed by my mom when my dad was already off to work or away on a business trip.","{

"Many of the world's pollution problems have been caused by the crowding of large groups of people into the cities. Supply for the needs of the people leads to further pollution by industry. If the rapid increase of world population in countries continues at the present rate, there may be much greater harm to human beings. Some scientists speak of the increase in numbers of people as ""population pollution.""
About 2,000 years ago, the world population was probably about 250 million. It reached a billion in 1850. By 1930 the population was two billion. It is now three and a half billion. It is expected to double by the year 2,000. If the population continues to grow at the same rate, there will be 25 billion in the world a hundred years from now.
Man has been using the earth's resources more and more rapidly over the past years. Some of them are almost used up. Now many people believe that man's greatest problem is how to control the growth of the population. The material supplies in the world will be far from enough to support the human population in time to come, if the present rate of increase continues. Already there is overcrowding in many cities and starvation in some countries. Should man's population keep on growing so rapidly as before? Many people believe that human survival in the future depends on the answer to this question.","{

"Take a class at Dulangkou School, and you'll see lots of things different from other schools, You can see the desks are not in rows and students sit in groups. They put their desks together so they're facing each other. How can they see the blackboard? There are three blackboards on the three walls of the classroom!
The school calls the new way of learning ""Tuantuanzuo"", meaning sitting in groups. Wei Liying, a Junior 3 teacher, said it was to give students more chances to communicate.
Each group has five or six students, according to Wei, and they play different roles .There is a team leader who takes care of the whole group. There is a ""study leader""who makes sure that everyone finishes their homework. And there is a discipline leader who makes sure that nobody chats in class.
Wang Lin is a team leader. The 15-year-old said that having to deal with so many things was tiring.
""I just looked after my own business before,""said Wang. ""But now I have to think about my five group members.""
But Wang has got used to it and can see the benefits now.
""I used to speak too little. But being a team leader means you have to talk a lot. You could even call me an excellent speaker today.""

"Have you ever wanted to enjoy the world's wonderful gifts? This earth is a beautiful place. If you look at nature, and see just trees, and grass, do you realize what incredible things you are missing? 
Go outside. If you want to feel more connected to the earth, the first step is to experience it for yourself. Choose a place that you think that you could thoroughly enjoy. A quiet place set away from civilization is best. One of the key things is that it must be calm and quiet. Any natural setting will do, whether it is a forest or grassland, lake or mountain. 
  Sit down on a rock, some dry leaves, or simply on the ground. Get comfortable with your surroundings, and really take in the sounds and the feel of everything around you. Try not to focus on ""the big picture""--stead, notice the little details of things; for example: how many ridges are there on a leaf? Do you see any animals around you? If so,  pay attention to kinds of things that happen lower to the ground. 
Next, close your eyes, and picture in your mind the nature that surrounds you. The point is to sense that you are in a beautiful place. 
  Do something peaceful, such as fishing or meditating in the woods. You will be amazed at how relaxing it is to just sit back and enjoy the natural sounds of the woods and birds. 
  Go on a hike. Walking is great exercise and the pace of it will allow you to see and hear the little things. Don't let time or distance scare you. There are hikes of all lengths and difficulties. 
  Go camping or backpacking. Don't forget to look at the stars, whether you know anything about them yet or not. Often, they will appear brighter and more numerous when you are away from the light and smog of cities. 
Practice primitive skills while in the woods to share a connection with our ancestors, if you want to go further. See the external links for suggestions. 
Doing these kinds of things will bring about an appreciation of nature, and make you realize how beautiful it is, and that we too, are creatures of this earth.","{

"I was at the post office early that morning, hoping to post a letter at the start of a busy day. Instead, , I found myself standing in a queue that went all the way into the hallway.I had never seen so many people there on a weekday. The queue moved very slowly.My patience ran out and I got angry. When I got to the counter finally, I finished my business quickly and briefly, and then walked past the queue that was now extending past the front door.
Thinking I was going to be late for my dentist  appointment, I was scowling   as I headed into the parking lot.
A woman was coming across the lot in my direction.She was walking with determination, and each step sounded very heavy.I noticed that she had a scowling on her face. Her body language said that she was having a really terrible day.My anger disappeared.I wished I could wrap her in a hug but I was a stranger. So I did what I could in a minute before she hurried past me-I smiled.In a second everything changed.She was surprised. Then her face softened and her shoulders relaxed.I saw her take a deep breath.Her pace slowed and she smiled back at me as we passed each other.
I continued to smile all the way to my car. Wow, it's amazing what a simple smile can do.From then on, I became aware of people's expressions and my own, the way we show our feelings.Now I use that awareness in my everyday life to let it remind me that when facing the world, I can try a smile.","{

"One Sunday a few of us decided to take advantage of the first sunny day we'd have for ages to take a trip down to the coast to visit the penguins again. Last time I went down there was a couple of months ago and it was a dull cold day. Sunday couldn't have been more different -- clear skies and sunshine made it feel like summer, although it was still -25degC.
Six of us drove to the coast. It was the first time we'd been off the base on our own without our field assistant, so it had a slightly different feeling -- more like a few friends going to the seaside than an Antarctic field trip! When we reached Windy Creek, we luckily caught sight of quite a few small flying seabirds, which are seldom seen there.
Once on the sea ice we found that some of the more curious penguins had wandered over from the main group to come and check us out. We'd been told that then they were nursing their chicks   and they would be more careful and nervous than last time,
We walked across to the main group which were stretched for a couple of miles along the coast. We sat down for some sandwiches and soon found ourselves surrounded by many curious observers. Without any attackers on land, they were very brave and came within a meter of us to pose   for photos.
Before heading back, we spent a few hours on the sea ice watching the penguins and their chicks, which had grown dramatically   since our last visit. It was such a nice day.","{

"How fit are your teeth? Are you lazy about brushing them? Never fear: An inventor is on the case. An electric toothbrush senses   how long and how well you brush, and it lets you track  your performance on your phone.
The Kolibree toothbrush was exhibited at the International Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas this week. It senses how it is moved and can send the information to an Android phone or iPhone via a Bluetooth wireless   connection.
The toothbrush will be able to teach you to brush right (don't forget the insides of the teeth!) and make sure you're brushing long enough. ""It's kind of like having a dentist actually watch your brushing on a day-to-day basis,"" says Thomas Serval, the French inventor.
The toothbrush will also be able to talk to other applications  on your phone, so developers could, for example, create a game controlled by your toothbrush. You could score points for beating monsters among your teeth. ""We try to make it smart and fun,"" Serval says.
Serval says he was inspired by his experience as a father. He would come home from work and ask his kids if they had brushed their teeth. They said ""yes,"" but Serval would find their toothbrush heads dry. He decided he needed a brush that really told him how well his children brushed.
The company says the Kolibree will go on sale this summer, from $99 to $199, and the U.S. is the first target market. ( )","{

"Nowadays,much of the profit of a business--sometimes the whole of its success--depends upon the use of the odds and ends.The odds and ends are various small things,which are left over when the main things are produced.But they possess a real value of their own.
If a business,big or small,looked down upon these odds and ends,it would mean a big difference in the amount of the benefit of the business.Take a meat factory for instance,there are countless odds and ends--bones and hair,which can be made into glue and rope to increase its profit greatly.
Then,if we are college students,what about our odds and ends--the odd moments?Take time for example.Every one of us has the exact same amount of it.Everyone's success or failure depends on the use of their time.But everyone uses the time more or less in the same way.However,why many great men in science or art have made huge successes for themselves in the world?Because they have made best use of their odd moments.Thomas A.Edison,never allowed his odd moments to slip by.He thought,planned,and tried his inventions.He always worked twenty hours out of each twentyfour.His inventions made him famous all over the world,and provided valuable wealth for the human beings.
So,remember this _ :busy people always find time  for everything.However,people with great spare time find time for nothing.Is it very strange?Not at all!The question is how to gather up fragments of time and make full use of them.As many big businesses have found,the real profit is in using the odds and ends.We also must do in this way to make best use of our odd moments and manage to be successful in something we do.","{

"If we find a bird nest  , we will have a good place of watching and knowing about birds. Birds sit on eggs and take care of their babies from April to June. Because the baby birds are too young to leave the nest, parents often go to look for food and come back in several minutes. So it is good to watch birds. When we watch birds, we'd better hide ourselves in a close place to the nest, and it's better to use binoculars  .
But how do we make a bird nest? A good bird nest must be very fine, strong, thick and comfortable. If you want to make one, please follow these:
a) Each nest must have six boards   for its cover and floor, for its left and right sides, and for its front and back sides. Don't make the boards too slippery  .
b) Dig a small hole in the front of the nest as a ""door"". The ""door"" is big enough so birds can fly in or out easily.
c) Make sure the rainwater can't go into the nest.
d) One piece of the board should be easy to open.
e) Don't forget to colour the nest.","{

"I grew up in the south of Spain in a little community called Estepona. I was 16 when one morning, my father told me I could drive him into a remote village called Mijas, about 18 miles away, on the condition that I take the car in to be serviced(,) at a nearby garage. Having just learned to drive and hardly ever having the opportunity to use the car, I readily accepted. I drove Dad into Mijas and promised to pick him up at 4 p.m., then drove to a nearby garage and dropped off the car. Because I had a few hours to spare, I decided to catch a couple of movies at a theatre near the garage. However, I became so interested in the films that I didn't pay attention to the time. When the last movie had finished, I looked down at my watch. It was six o'clock. I was two hours late!
I knew Dad would be angry if he found out I'd been watching movies. He'd never let me drive again. I decided to tell him that the car needed some repairs and that they had taken longer than had been expected. I drove up to the place where we had planned to meet and saw Dad waiting patiently on the corner. I apologized for being late and told him that I'd come as quickly as I could, but the car had needed some major repairs. I'll never forget the look he gave me.
""I'm disappointed that you feel you have to lie to me, Jason.""
""What do you mean? I'm telling the truth.""
Dad looked at me again. ""When you did not show up, I called the garage to ask if there were any problems, and they told me that you had not yet picked up the car. So you see, I know there were no problems with the car."" A feeling of guilt ran through me as I weakly confessed to my trip to the movie theatre and the real reason for my being late. Dad listened intently  as a sadness passed through him.
""I'm angry, not with you but with myself. You see, I realize that I have failed as a father if after all these years you feel that you have to lie to me. I have failed because I have brought up a son who cannot even tell the truth to his own father. I'm going to walk home now and think seriously about where I have gone wrong all these years.""
""But Dad, it's 18 miles to home. It's dark. You can't walk home.""
My protests and my apologies were useless. I had let my father down and I was about to learn one of the most painful lessons of my life. Dad began walking along the dusty road. I quickly jumped in the car and followed behind, hoping he would weaken. I begged all the way, telling him how sorry I was, but he simply ignored me, continuing on silently, thoughtfully and painfully. For 18 miles I drove behind him, at a speed of about five miles per hour.
Seeing my father in so much physical and emotional pain was the most distressing  and painful experience that I have ever faced. However, it was also the most successful lesson. I have never lied to him since.","{

""Somehow I was cured and I became a normal kid,"" Fujiyama says. ""And I had a second chance.""
During his second year at the University of Mary Washington, he volunteered in Honduras with a campus group and was struck by the extreme poverty he saw--barefoot children collecting cans and sleeping in the streets. Fujiyama realized he could help give other children their own second chance.
Today, his organization, Students Helping Honduras, brings education and community projects to children and families in need.
He started by telling his friends about his experience and collecting spare change at his two campus jobs. ""When I had my very first meeting, only two people showed up,"" he says. ""I knew I had to keep fighting."" He persuaded his younger sister, Cosmo, to join the cause. ""She's dynamite,."" He says. ""When she talks in front of a crowd, she can move mountains. Knowing that she was behind it, I knew I could do anything."" Since 2006, the _ organization has grown to 25 campuses and raised more than $750,000 to fund projects, including the construction of two schools and the establishment of scholarships to help young women attend college.
Fujiyama says students are deeply committed to the organization. They raise money and then travel to Honduras to help building houses. While Fujiyama spends his summers in Honduras working alongside volunteers, he spends a large portion of the year on the road visiting colleges to raise funds. Cosmo Fujiyama, 23, lives in Honduras full time to coordinate the group's building efforts on the ground.
Students Helping Honduras is working with community members of Siete de Abril to build a new village. Many of the families lost their belongings in Hurricane Mitch in 1998. A lot of them didn't have access to clean water or health care, and they didn't have a school. Fujiyama's group helped build 44 homes in the village named ""Sunshine Village"". The organization is also raising funds to build a water tower, an eco-friendly sanitation system and a library.","{

"The southwest of Australia has been named as one of 25""hot spots"" for future species extinction because of global warming.A new study says global warming will become a top cause of extinction across the world,with thousands of species of plantsand animals likely to be wiped out in the coming decades.
According to the study,global warming ranks among the most serious threats to the planet's biodiversity and,under some conditions,may be more than that due to deforestation.This study provides even stronger scientific evidence that global warming will result in catastrophic species losses across the planet.Last month,a UN study said humans were responsible for the worst extinction and urged extra efforts to reach a UN target of slowing the rate of losses by 2010.
Scientists disagree about how far global warming is to blame compared with other human threats such as deforestation,pollution and the introduction of some species to new habitats.But the new study looks at the 25 ""hot spots""--areas that contain a big concentration of plants and animals--and predicts that 11.6 percent of all species,with a range from 1 to 43 percent,could be driven to extinction if levels of heat trapping gases in the atmosphere were to keep rising in the next 100 years.
The range would mean the loss of thousands of species.The study gave a wide range because of uncertainties, for instance, about the ability of animals or plants to move towards the poles if the climate warmed. Rare plants,tortoises or birds found only on the southern tip of Africa cannot move south because the nearest land is thousands of miles away in Antarctica.","{

"My sisters and I have dreamt of a home in the city, but when the Alcott family found itself in a small house at the South End without a tree in sight, only a back yard to play in, and no money to buy any of the beautiful things before us, we children all opposed it and longed for the country again.
Anna soon found little pupils, and walked away each morning to her daily task, pausing at the corner to wave her hand to me in answer to my greet with the duster . My father went to his office downtown, mother to her helping the poor, the little girls to school, and I, Lousia, was left to keep house, feeling like an aged sea-gull as I washed dishes and cooked in the basement kitchen where the only thing I could hope for was someone talking with me.
Good drill, but very hard, and my only comfort was the evening reunion where all met with such various reports of the day's adventures, we could not fail to find both amusement and instruction.
Father brought interesting and attractive news from the upper world; mother, usually in low spirits because she would give away her clothes with sad tales of suffering from the darker side of life; gentle Anna gave a modest account of her success as a teacher, for even at seventeen her sweet nature won all who knew her, and her patience gained her the support of the most naughty pupil.
My reports were usually a mixture of sadness and happiness, and the children poured their small joys and troubles into the family where comfort and mercy were always to be found.","{

"The first visit to a foreign country that I can remember was when I was about seven years old. We live about 5 miles away from the Canadian border . My family and I went to Parc Safari, Quebec, a wonderful place that has animals and rides. We drove down a nice long road. My sister and I sat in the back of the car, and it was a hatchback  so we opened it up. I remember feeding the animals snacks we had bought for ourselves.
The time we went we were told there would not be monkeys because they had escaped and had not been found. I remember thinking to myself, how cool it would be to see a monkey in our backyard.
Even though the monkeys were not there it was still so much fun. When we reached the area that had camels, giraffes and other animals, I remember one of the camels reached into the car to get our snacks. However, we were a little _ because the camels seemed to froth  at the mouth and we had camel slobber  all over the car and us.
It was one of the best family vacations that I can remember. It was not too far from home, it was in a different country and it was with my family. I cannot remember if we went on the rides or not but seeing many animals was a great time. Now I am grown up and have a son, and I am planning to go there again. He is 7 years old and I think he is at a great age to enjoy a trip like this. I am sure it has changed a lot over the years but it will still be a great family trip.","{

"Hong Kong, major commercial center for Asia, and with a population which has grown at an alarming rate to over 5 million, is a city highly dependent on mass (, ) transit of all sorts, both local and long distance. An ordinary Hong Kong worker or businessman, going about his daily activities, simply must use transportation at one time or another.
Because Hong Kong is in two parts, Kowloon, on the mainland side, and Hong Kong, the island, with Hong Kong's harbor in between Hong Kong's mass transit systems, in addition to going over land they must also cross water.
Going from home to work, or going shopping from one side of the harbor to the other, the Hong Kong resident has three choices. One way is to take a bus which will cross the harbor through an under water traffic tunnel moving slowly through bumper- to-bumper   traffic.Another way is by ferry boat , a pleasant ride which crosses the harbor in from seven to fifteen  minutes.
But by far the fastest way of crossing the harbor is the newly built underground electric railway, the Hong Kong Metro . If one gets on the train in the Central District,the commercial area of Hong Kong on the island side, he can speed across the harbor in an astonishing three minutes. On the other side of the harbor the railway continues, snaking back and forth through the outlying districts of Kowloon, allowing one to get off a short distance from his destination.
The story of the Metro is an encouraging one for supporters of mass transit. Although building the system was certainly a challenging task, the Japanese firm hired to construct it did so in record time. Construction got underway in 1979 and it was completed in 1980.
For the average commuter   the system has only one disadvantage; it is more expensive than by bus or ferry. One can ride the bus across the harbor for half as much or he can ride the ferry across for less than one-fifth as much.","{

"If you're in Florence, Italy, and see a man on a ladder wiping the dust off statues and buildings, don't worry.It's just Alessandro Ricci gathering material for his famous smog paintings.
Ricci is not a common artist, because he used smog as the main medium of his artworks. Unlike other painters seeking fast recognition of their talent, he doesn't really care about ""being this big artist"".Instead he is more concerned about bringing attention to how much smog there really is in his home town and how it's destroying both its monuments and people.
Although he did take a couple of art classes a few years back, he is mainly self-taught, doesn't work in a studio, donates most of his work, and refuses to play by the rules of the Florentine Art Gallery, which he considers corrupt.Alessandro Ricci believes selling his smog paintings will not only compromise his principles, but also contradict the very thing he's trying to do-raise awareness about smog pollution in this city.
Alessandro lives with his parents nearby Florence, but almost every day he visits the streets of the city, and collects smog for his paintings.He gets it from several meters above ground, from clean surfaces like marble, plastic and stone, using damp pieces of cotton.Then he applies the smog directly onto a cloth and creates street scenes and reproductions of the very buildings from which he got the dangerous material.Finally, he seals his paintings with a natural resin  .
His actions helped win a small victory for the people of Florence, as in October 25, 2012 the Duomo area of the city was made pedestrian-only.But there is still a long way to go, the artist believes, and only cleaning the thick layer of smog that has accumulated throughout Florence would take several years.Still, he continues to paint his unique smog artworks and let the people know how polluted the environment they live in really is.","{

"As I sat beside the window of our classroom that afternoon, my heart sank further with each passing car. This was a day I'd looked forward to for weeks: Miss Pace's fourth-grade, end-of-the-year party. I had happily volunteered my mother when Miss Pace looked for cookie volunteers. Mom's chocolate chips were well-known, and I knew they'd be a hit with my classmates. But two o'clock passed, and there was no sign of her. Most of the other mothers had already come and gone, dropping off their sweet offerings. The three o'clock bell soon took me away from my thoughts and I took my book bag from my desk. I decided I would slam the front door, and refuse to return her hug.
But when I arrived, she wasn't at home. I was lying face-down on my bed upstairs when I heard her come through the front door. ""Robbie,"" she called out a bit urgently. ""Where are you?"" I could then hear her rushing anxiously from room to room, wondering where I could be. I remained silent. Coming through the door, she said: ""I'm so sorry, honey,"" she said. ""I just forgot. I got busy and forgot."" Then my mother did something completely unexpected. She began to laugh! How could she laugh at a time like this? I rolled over and faced her, ready to let her see my rage  . But my mother wasn't laughing at all. She was crying. ""I'm so sorry,"" she said. ""I let you down. I let my little boy down.""
I was moved by her tears. I tried to remember her kind words from times past when I'd skinned knees or cut myself, times when she knew just the right thing to say. ""It's okay, Mom. We didn't even need those cookies. There was plenty of stuff to eat. Don't cry. It's all right. Really."" We didn't say another word. We just held each other.

"These days, when the world seems to be hard to control, walking can make you feel peaceful. It gives you a chance to slow down, to relax and to appreciate yourself and your life in general. It helps you slow down enough to breathe deeply, to calm your thoughts, and to research the natural world filled with wonders. And yes, to love yourself more.
Try to spend one day for a long travel on foot--far from the requirements of work and family. First, choose a date and mark it as your ""relaxing day"". Next, choose a place that you want to visit on foot. If you enjoy being out in nature, head to a wide and open place. Try to choose a place that's no more than 15 minutes from your home. You want to spend your time walking, not driving.
Walk at an easy speed so you can walk longer and farther. If you normally walk two miles a day, go for four to six miles. Wear comfortable clothes. If it's warm, wear a hat to protect your face. And don't forget your sunglasses-- not only to protect your eyes but also to give you a sense of privacy while you walk.
Before you go out, get up early so you can spend a few minutes relaxing. Relaxing is something few people spend in their spare time, but it leaves you feeling much lighter and less annoyed. Read something relaxing before you leave home, and it'll put you in a different condition of mind. And, of course, eat a healthy breakfast and drink plenty of water. Then pick up your backpack and head out. And enjoy yourself.","{

"Education is another area where the presence of arts and crafts is more than welcome. If children realize the importance of art and creativity from a young age, they can grow up to be more confident, more creative, and definitely more mature. Schools are the breeding grounds for future painters and movie makers, and these arts should be encouraged wholesomely in such an environment.
Sadly, many parents do not understand why art is important for children, and subconsciously force them to follow career paths that are common and conformist in nature. This is fair enough in its own way, because the world does need some standard blue collar and white collar jobs to continue its existence; but this is a choice that children should be allowed to make for themselves. The doors to creativity and expression must not be shut in their faces, even if it comes at a cost of making more money.
To put it more scientifically, here are some benefits of kids' art activities that give a suitable answer to the question ""Why is art important in schools?""
1.Exposure to art, music and drawings at an early age improves the amount of brain activity in children.
2.It increases the span of knowledge in the minds of children, thus making them sharper and more educated.
3.It builds up the levels of self-confidence, self-esteem , motivation, cooperation and communication in children.

"Adrian's ""Amazing Race"" started early when his parents realized that he, as a baby, couldn't hear a thing, not even loud noises. In a special school for the hearing-impaired, he learned sign language and got to mix with other disabled children. However, the sight of all the disabled children communicating with one another upset his mother. She wanted him to lead a normal life. So after speaking to an advisor, she sent him to private classes where he learned to read lips and pronounce words.
Later on, Adrian's parents decided to send him to a regular school. But the headmaster tried to prevent them from doing so, saying regular school couldn't take care of a special needs students. His parents were determined to take the risk and push him hard to go through his work everyday because they wanted to prove that, given the opportunity, he could do anything. Adrian made the grade and got accepted. It was a big challenge. The pace   was faster so he had to sit at the front of the class and really pay attention to the teacher, which wasn't always easy. But he stuck to it and did a lot of extra work after school.
The efforts made by Adrian and his parents paid off. Adrian graduated with good grades and got into a top high school. He also achieved a lot in life outside school.

"Long ago, Bluebird's feathers were the colour of dust. She did not like her ugly colour. She was attracted by the colour of the lake near her home. It was as blue as the sky after a storm. Bluebird wanted to be the colour of that beautiful lake very much. Flapping her wings one morning, Bluebird flew from her tree to the blue lake. Then she bathed in the water three times. After each bath, she sang, ""Blue water. Still water. I went in. I am blue."" Bluebird repeated this every morning. On the third day, she came out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers.
Now Coyote was a trickster --and hungry too. He stayed behind Bluebird's tree for a long time every day and watched her go to the lake. He pretended  to be interested in everything she did. He wanted Bluebird for lunch, but he was afraid of the blue water. On the third morning, Coyote saw Bluebird come out of the lake with beautiful blue feathers. Impressed, he sat next to Bluebird's tree and waited for her. When she returned, he asked, ""How did you get blue feathers? I want to be blue like the mountains too."" Bluebird didn't believe Coyote, but she taught him how to bathe three times each morning and how to sing her song. Coyote did what she said, and after three days of bathing in the lake, his white fur turned deep blue.
Convinced  that blue fur was even more beautiful than blue feathers, Coyote forgot all about being hungry. He ran as fast as he could to the top of the hill. Standing on his back legs, he raised his front legs off the ground and howled. But Coyote slipped  and rolled down the hill. He couldn't stop himself, and the dust and dirt covered his new blue fur. He rolled and rolled until he hit into Bluebird's tree heavily. No matter how much he tried, foolish Coyote could not shake the dust from his fur. And so the fur of all coyotes had the dull colour of dust to this very day.","{

"Ever wonder how this season's celebrations affect the environment? Guest blogger Krista Fairles takes an amusing look at this very topic:
The holidays are a wonderful, cheerful time when most people wait for Santa to bring them presents. But I'm not like most people. I spend my time wondering just what the environmental impacts of Santa Claus and his reindeer are, and more importantly, how I can calculate those impacts.
Lately I've been particularly curious as to whether Santa's old sled is a clean green flying machine, or if he should be replacing his 8 reindeer with an environmentally-friendly car.
I should mention that, surprisingly, I was unable to find statistics specific to Santa's magical flying reindeer, so these calculations use numbers from various sources and may not represent actual pollution caused by Santa and his animals. In other words, don't complain to the government about the damage Santa is causing the environment based on this article.
Santa's yearly trip around the globe is 44,000km long, twice the average of a North American driver. If we assume that the magic provides the altitude for this trip, then reindeer power only needs to push Santa's sled forward. To complete the trip in 12 hours, I estimate they must travel at a speed of about 3100km/h. To travel at this speed, for this length of time, the reindeer need to eat an incredible 980 million calories each!!
So the next question is: how much food is in 980 million calories? Well, if they're eating corn, they'd need to eat 16,500 lbs each -- or 1.6 acres of food. Growing 12.8 acres of corn has its own implications for the environment that we'll leave for another calculation.
We now need to consider that during the global trip the reindeer are ""letting out"" some of that corn in the form of methane (,). A resting cow produces 110 kg of methane per year, so flying reindeer would each let out about 4.8 tons.

"I spend a lot of time backpacking and hiking the outdoors and there are two pieces of equipment that are with me on each trip: an Adventure Medical Kits Weekender and an Adventure Medical Kits Suture Syringe Kit. Both proved very helpful on my most recent adventures to the Wrangell in Alaska.
On that day, we were ""blessed"" with rain, making our water crossing on the Dixie Pass very difficult. Our party of 12 had almost reached our destination when I slipped, severely gashing  my knee open in the process. While I could not see the wound at first because of the rain pants I was wearing, I knew _ was severe.
Blood was running freely and I made those standing nearby aware of the damage. They quickly came over to assist, pulled my pack off and removed the Weekender First Aid Kit and Suture Kit from it. Fortunately, one of my partners is a doctor called William, who has often performed this type of work in the operating room, not out in the wild.
I seriously think he was more nervous about all this than me! I, of course, was more than happy that I did not have to stitch  myself up. As a marine, I've had to do it before. Fortunately, the sky had cleared up about two hours before, so we had great sunlight to work with. The doctor worked quickly with the assistance of another fellow camper acting as a nurse and placed seven stitches into my knee once the wound had been cleaned up.
Later that evening we used a syringe  we set aside loaded with Iodine  to clean the wound and then bandaged it again. The doctor was very impressed with the kits contents!
I've already ordered another Suture Syringe Kit. I have to say the kits are worth their weight in gold! Thanks for the contents in the kits!","{

"There was great excitement on the planet of Venus   . Venusian scientists managed to land a satellite on the planet Earth, and it has been sending back signals as well as photographs ever since.
The satellite was directed into an area known as Manhattan, named after the great Venusian astronomer Professor. Manhattan, who first discovered it with his telescope 20000 light years ago.
Because of excellent weather conditions and extremely strong signals, Venusian scientists were able to get valuable information as to feasibility   of a manned flying saucer landing on Earth. A press conference was held at the Venus Institute of Technology.
""We have come to the conclusion, based on last week's satellite landing,"" Prof. Zog said, ""that there is no life on Earth.""
""How do you know this?"" the science reporter of the Venus Evening Star asked.
""For one thing, Earth's surface in the area of Manhattan is made up of solid concrete and nothing can grow there. For another, the atmosphere is filled with carbon monoxide   and other deadly gases and nobody could possibly breathe this air and survive.""
""What does this mean as far as our flying saucer program is concerned?""
""We shall have to take our own oxygen with us, which means a much heavier flying saucer than originally planned.""
""Are there any other dangers that you discovered in your studies?""
""Take a look at this photo. You see this dark black cloud hovering   over the surface of Earth? We don't know what it is made of, but it could give us a lot of trouble and we shall have further tests before we send a Venus Being there.""
""Over here you will notice what seems to be a river, but the satellite findings indicates it is polluted and the water is unfit to drink. This means we shall have to carry our own water, which will add even greater weight to the saucer.""
""If all you say is true, won't this set back the flying saucer program several years?""
""Yes, but we shall continue as soon as the Grubstart gives us the added funds ."" Profession. Zog replied.","{

"Recently a friend of mine wrote to me about her experience in Holland: 
A very old man asked me to come to his apartment, and he would donate a bike to the project. I went over to get it, and it was half a bike, which was locked to a pole and had obviously been there for years. The temperature was well below zero. It became clear that he was in fact super-lonely, and torn between usual Dutch distrust of strangers and desperation for human contact. He finally begged me to come up to his apartment (where he obviously lived alone). 
         You may know that Dutch people are the tallest in the world, reflecting a very high standard of living. But -- if this old man is not unusual -- reducing the loneliness of old people isn't part of the Dutch social contact, admirable as  _ may be.
         I recently watched the Frontline program Sick Around the World. It suggested that the old man isn't unusual. In England, where doctor visits are free, a doctor said he has several patients who come weekly, purely because they're lonely. In Japan, some patients have their blood pressure measured very often -- most probably for the same reason. In Taiwan, if you see a doctor 20 times in one month, someone from the government will come to talk to you. Not about loneliness -- about overuse of medical care. The Frontline program made nothing of any of these facts, which were included to show that access was easy. Really the idea that everyone needs human contact isn't mysterious or controversial.
         My explanation is there's a double blow: Not only do lonely old people have little power, it's also clear that their problem (loneliness) isn't caused by a ""chemical imbalance"". So no drugs can be sold to treat it. And there's no diagnostic category. When these lonely old people use what little power they have by visiting their doctor, the doctor -- I'm assuming -- doesn't do anything to get rid of the loneliness. Even if you visit 20 times in a month.","{

"Flexible working hours, homeworking opportunities and cover for emergencies or school holidays are the top concerns for working mothers, according to a British survey on Thursday.
The survey of 1,677 people by specialist employment advice website workingmums.co.uk showed that despite a tougher job climate, in which redundancies  had risen dramatically during the crisis, mothers demanded for a more flexible schedule.
Flexible hours for full-time jobs came top of the list for 85 percent of respondents who were asked what they thought made for a family-friendly employer. That came just ahead of homeworking opportunities.
""Flexibility is really key and able to help achieve an element of work/life balance,"" workingmums.co.uk founder Gillian Nissim told reporters.
She said the crisis had not reduced the urgency of this issue for working mums and that employers who want to be prepared for the eventual upturn would do well to listen to them rather than risk losing them to more forward-thinking rivals.
Many women said they had considered setting up their own business as a way around the flexibility problem and nearly half (45 percent) of respondents said they had looked into it.
Nissim said the workingmums.co.uk database alone showed that on average working mums have more than 15 years of work experience and a range of valuable skills picked up in the workplace and from their parenting experiences.
""So the benefits to employers of being able to accommodate   a degree of flexibility is significant,"" she said.
Part-time work, flexibility around emergency cover or school holidays were the next highest concerns with extended maternity   pay as well on the list of concerns.More than half (54 percent) of respondents said they would accept a less well-paid job in return for flexibility, with 40 percent prepared to consider this option.","{

Most cities and towns have no rules about opening and closing times for stores or restaurants, though they usually do make rules for bars. Especially in large cities, stores may be open 24 hours a day.

"Here's an unusual story: a diamond ring was recently found in an egg. The magician , Liu Qian, discovered it, in front of an audience of millions at CCTV's Spring Festival Gala. Liu's magic tricks have made the centuries old art of magic fashionable once again, and made him the hottest magician in China.
As a _ young magician from Taiwan, Liu is popular worldwide for his magic shows. Countries he has performed in include the United States, Japan, South Korea and the UK.
Witnessing something impossible happen right before your eyes is the root of people's love for magic.
Liu is known for his interaction  with his audiences. He has a unique understanding of showmanship  .
""It is actually thinking, rather than one's manipulation skills, that is more important to achieving a successful magic show. We think carefully about how to design the shows creatively, to make them appear more intriguing ,""Liu said.
Liu Qian's success dates back to his childhood. Born in 1976 in Taiwan, he found himself attracted to a magic toy in a shop when he was seven years old. At the age of 12, he won Taiwan's Youth Magic Contest, which was judged by the great American magician, David Copperfield.
Yet, Liu never planned on becoming a professional magician. He studied Japanese literature at university and only hoped to be an amateur  magician in his spare time. However, his failure to find a decent job after graduation pushed him towards magic as a career.
To refine  his performing skills, he has performed on streets, roads and fields, for pedestrians , policemen and farmers.

"Proverbs  are quite common in spoken English. We do not normally put them in a composition or letter. Sometimes it is helpful if you know what common proverbs mean. Here are a few examples:
Once bitten, twice shy. If a dog bites me, I shall be twice as careful in future when I see it. This proverb is also used to apply to many things and not only to dogs. If you have been cheated at a shop, you will not go to the same shop again.
A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. If I am a hunter, trying to catch birds, it is better to catch one bird than to see two birds in a bush but not be able to catch them. Thus this means that what you have already got is better than the chance of being able to get something bigger in the future.
Too many cooks spoil the broth(soup). When too many people do something together, they get in each other's way and cannot do a good job.
To pour oil on troubled waters Is to try to calm things down. Oil is lighter than water. If a ship is in trouble at sea, another ship may come to help it. The second ship can send small boats to rescue people. However, it may first pour oil on the sea to make the sea less rough.
Don't be a dog in a manger . Means "" Don't be selfish."" In a stable , the manger is the place where the horse's food is put. Sometimes a dog will sleep in the manger and bard when a horse comes to get its food. The dog does not want to eat the hay in the manger but it will not let the horse eat it.
He's sitting on the fence. Means that somebody will not say whether he is in favour of a plan or against it. He is sitting on a fence between two opposing sides, perhaps waiting to see which side will win.
He who pays the piper calls the tune. A piper is a musician . The man who employs or pays a musician can say what tunes the man will play. Thus this means that if a man provides the money for a plan, he can say how it will be carried out.
You can't get blood out of a stone means that you can't get something out of a person who has not got any of the things you want. For example, you cannot get a million dollars from a poor man.","{

"In tests, it shrank breast tumours by 80 percent and researchers believe it could also treat prostate, pancreatic, bowel and ovarian cancers. Even tumours that resist treatment with the best medicines on the market, including the ""wonder drug"" Herceptin, may surrender to the vaccine. The experiments so far have been on mice - but researchers hope to pilot the drug on people within two years. If all goes well, the vaccine could be on the market by 2020.
         Rather than attacking cancer cells, like many drugs, the new treatment arouses the power of the immune system to fight tumours. The search for vaccines has been prevented by fears that healthy tissue would be destroyed along with tumours.
         Researchers from the University of Georgia and the Mayo Clinic in the US focused on a protein called MUC1 that is made in bigger amounts in cancerous cells than in healthy ones.Not only is there more of it, but a sugar that it is ""decorated"" with has a distinctive shape.
         The vaccine trains the immune system to recognise the rogue sugar and turn its weapons against the cancer. ""Cancer cells have a special way of thwarting the immune system by putting sugars on the surface of tumour cells so they can travel around the body without being detected,"" researcher Professor Sandra Gendler said.

"Nobody likes an old poop . Developing a sense of humor is part of becoming a mature, emotionally healthy individual. Laughter is good for the soul, builds friendships and relieves stress. It serves as the glue for social situations and as an ice-breaker for sadness and boredom. If you've ever been told to ""lighten up"" or ""chill out"", you should save the blue attitude for serious situations and develop your sense of humor.
Forgive the accidental. A sudden fall is humorous not because we like to see people fall, but because it surprises. From a spilled water glass in a meeting to Aunt Rae's teeth coming off in the Thanksgiving turkey, the embarrassment of accidents can be relieved by humor and a helping hand. After making sure that nobody's hurt, forgive accidents with a chuckle rather than a scolding.
Look for the unexpected. The kid who used to look at you with his eyes closed during a test had the idea. Parents who serve green eggs and ham to their children on graduation day get the idea. Unexpected actions lighten an atmosphere and relax people.
Learn to laugh with your kids. Most of what children say and do is funny. Help them learn that accidents are sometimes funny and sometimes occasions for joining in and helping another human being. By sharing laughs and attempting to explain humor, you develop your sense of humor, as well as help kids develop their own sense of humor.","{

"Since the 1990s, education has been required for all South Africans from age seven to fifteen. Last December, the government announced that 70% of students passed their final examination to finish high school. In 2008, the pass rate was about 63%. There have been increases each year since then.
Professor Shireen Motala says basic education is no longer a problem in South Africa. Most children stay in school until they are about sixteen. The problem is that large numbers of them leave without completing high school.
Students take an examination known as the ""matric""  in Grade Twelve. Professor Motala says, ""Less than half of the children who started school in 2000 sat for the matric last year. Many dropped out of school, so only around 45% took the matric. And the worry is where those students actually go."" Those who drop out have to compete with better educated people for jobs.
Educational researchers also point to another problem. South African schools do not produce enough students with the skills for higher education in maths and science. Many schools are not well-equipped. Children do not see laboratories, and, as a result, their science marks are not very good. They do not have libraries at school. Also, many teachers do not have the skills or training to do their jobs.
In South Africa, a number of teachers were poorly trained before. Secondly, teachers have been confused by the many educational reform efforts in the last fifteen years. Finally, language differences in the classroom have not got as much attention as they should, which is a huge problem. Subjects such as maths and science are taught in English starting at about the age of ten. But South Africa has eleven official languages.
South Africa's minister of basic education promises a number of improvements. Angie Motshega says teacher development efforts will focus on subject and content knowledge, making sure that the correct teachers are in the correct jobs.","{

"Airtight plastic bags can help farmers protect their harvests without the use of harmful chemicals. These bags are designed to keep air out of crops in storage. Using them is a simple way to fight insects and keep crops fresh.
    Ten countries in West and Central Africa are involved in a project to improve the storage of cowpeas, also
known as black-eyed peas. Farmers can lose much of the harvest to insects called bruchids  , which grow from egg to adult in a few weeks and then lay forty to sixty eggs. They can destroy the whole harvest within months.
    Farmers can sell their crops immediately. But selling at harvest time means more competition and lower prices.Or they can use pesticides   to kill the bugs. But a crop scientist Dieudonne Baributsa says, ""They end up misusing or overusing the pesticide. In Nigeria, they have reported a lot of cases of death. They usually call cowpeas 'killer beans' in Nigeria.""
    Mr. Baributsa is a researcher at Purdue University in Indiana, America. The project is called PICS---Purdue Improved Cowpea Storage. He says the storage bags are thick enough that any insects already in the cowpeas willdie from a lack of oxygen. The lack of air will also help prevent the growth of bacteria that can ruin the harvest. The bags cost about two dollars each. Mr. Baributsa says that is not much, especially if it means farmers can wait long enough to get a better price for their crops. The bags are produced locally. Donors currently support the project, but the groups involved are working to build a lasting market for the bags because donation for the project will not lastforever.
    A company based in the United States called GrainPro makes another kind of airtight bags. These are called SuperGrainbags. Phil Villers, the company's president, says storing a harvest safely not only helps farmers earn more money, but also reduces the amount of the harvest loss to insects, spoilage and mishandling. ""What does not get wasted and eaten means it is possible to feed a hungry world,"" said Phil Villers.","{

Unemployment does not have the same horrible consequences today as it did in the 1930's when most of the unemployed were primary breadwinners, when income and earnings were usually much closer to the margin of survival, and when there were fewer effective social programs for those failing in the labor market. Increasing wealth, the rise of families with more than one wage earner, the growing dominance of secondary earners among the unemployed and improved social welfare protection have unquestionably relieved the consequences of joblessness. Earnings and income data also overestimate the scale of hardship. Among the millions with hourly earnings at or below the minimum wage level, the majority are from multiple-earner,  ly well-off families. Most of those counted by the poverty statistics are elderly or handicapped or have family responsibilities which keep them out of the labor force, so the poverty statistics are by no means an accurate indicator of labor market problems.
Yet there are also many ways our social statistics underestimate the degree of labor-market-related hardship. The unemployment counts exclude the millions of fully employed workers whose wages are so low that their families remain in poverty. Low wages and repeated or long-time unemployment frequently interact to weaken the capacity for self-support. Since the number experiencing joblessness at some time during the year is several times that unemployed in any month, those who suffer as a result of forced idleness can equal or exceed average annual unemployment, even though only a minority of the jobless in any month really suffer. For every person counted in the monthly unemployment totals, there is another working part-time because of the inability to find full-time work, or else outside the labor force but wanting a job. Finally, income transfers in our country have always focused on the elderly, disabled, and dependent, neglecting the needs of the working poor, so that the dramatic expansion of cash and non-cash transfers does not necessarily mean that those failing in the labor market are adequately protected.
As a result of such conflicting evidence, it is uncertain whether those suffering seriously as a result of labor market problems number in the hundreds of thousands or the tens of millions, and, hence, whether high levels of joblessness can be tolerated or must be counteracted  by job creation and economic stimulation. There is only one area of agreement in this debate--that the existing poverty, employment, and earnings statistics are inadequate for one of their primary applications, measuring the consequences of labor market problems.","{

"All work and no play makes Jack a dull boy. That saying holds true not only for you and me, but also for some of the most powerful and influential people in the world, such as the presidents of the United States.
But how do American presidents spend their vacation time? Let's take a look!
Franklin D. Roosevelt, considered one of the greatest presidents in American history, had limited vacation options because of his polio . He began visiting Warm Springs, Georgia in 1924 for its curative waters and later built a 2,000 acre polio treatment center nearby. He liked to cruise the Potomacon his yacht  and three times as president returned to his beloved Canadian island of Campobello, with which he fell in love as a kid.
Former President Bill Clinton, however, was never much good at vacationing. His staff had to practically force him to go on vacation his first year in office; his idea of relaxing was reading four good books simultaneously  while enjoying a cigar (chewed, not smoked). He could also lose himself in a game of golf, where his somewhat flexible interpretation of the rules could at times drive his partners crazy.
Obama's predecessor  also knows how to relax. Fishing is in the Bush family DNA: for blue sharks off the coast of Maine or anything with fins, almost anywhere else. George W. Bush also relaxed as president by jogging and clearing brush on his Texas ranch. Since leaving office, he has become an active mountain biker and, more recently, has taken up painting.
Obama tends to take a winter break in Hawaii, where he was born and raised, and a summer vacation in Martha's Vineyard, off the southern coast of Cape Cod, Massachusetts. In between, he plays basketball every couple of weeks and has been known to do some skeet shooting at Camp David. Obama's favorite pastime, no matter the location, has become easy to spot: golf.","{

"One day, a train was approaching the small town of Cheekyville. On the train was a young man with a big suitcase. He was called William Warbler, and he looked very common indeed. What made him most unusual, though, was the fact that whenever he needed to communicate he did it by singing opera  . It didn't matter to William whether it was simply a matter of answering a brief greeting, like ""good day"". He would clear his voice and respond, ""Gooood dayyy to youuuuuuuu... toooooo!""
No one could get a normal spoken word out of him and no one knew how he made his living. As he lived quite simply, always wearing his same old second-hand suit, people often looked down on him.
William had been in Cheekyville for some years, when, one day, word spread round town like wildfire: William had played a role in a very important opera in the nation's capital. Everyone in the capital went to see it, and it was a great success. Everyone in Cheekyville felt it was a surprise. But something more surprising was, when William was being interviewed by reporters, he answered their questions by speaking rather than singing. And he did it with great manners, and with a clear and pleasant voice.
From that day, William gave up singing at all hours. Now he did it only during his stage appearances and world tours. Some people suspected why he had changed, but others continued believing him to be somewhat mad. They wouldn't have thought so if they had seen what William kept in his big suitcase. It was a large stone, with a hand-carved   message on it. The message said: ""Practice, my boy. Practice every second, for you never know when your chance will come.""
Little did people realize that he only got the role in the opera because the director had heard William singing while out buying a newspaper.","{

"The child of today owes much of its pleasant school life to the work of Maria Montessori and others who felt as she did.
 Maria Montessori was born in 1870 in northern prefix = st1 /Italy. Both her parents were well educated.
 While Maria was a student, she took great interest in the study of the particular nature of the child's mind. It came to her that small children should have freedom  to learn.
 Maria became a doctor and a professor at RomeUniversity. In 1907, after working with backward students, she was given a chance to try out her ideas on children. There were sixty children, aged three to six, in the Children's House. The rooms were bright and color1ful. Maria let the children make their own choice of what they wanted to do and work with their own speed. They became busy, peaceful and happy.
  Maria Montessori was one of the world's great teachers. She traveled in Europe, Americaand Far East. She thought that true education, providing  for the real needs of the child, would produce wise and happy grown-ups and therefore a peaceful world. Her original way of education has changed our whole idea of what childhood is.

"Something as simple as a smile can mean friendliness in one culture, but impatience in another. Even silence means different things in different places.
When trying to communicate in a foreign language, it's natural to use gestures as a way of explaining your points.
Tapping your finger to your temple is a gesture to show memory in North America, but suggests insanity in Russia. Even nodding one's head to show ""yes"" or shaking one's head to show ""no"" can be misunderstood abroad. The yes-no gestures are different in countries like Bulgaria and Albania. In Turkey, ""no"" is gestured by nodding the head up and down.
It's not just individual gestures that can cause miscommunication, but the rate of gesturing can also cause miscommunication. Some countries, like Italy and Spain, are known for talking with their hands. Others use few body movements as a form of politeness. In parts of East Asia, the gesture is considered unpleasant behavior, and even rude.
Britain, along with many countries of northern Europe and the Far East, is classed as a ""non-contact""culture, in which there's very little physical contact in people's daily communication. Even accidentally touching someone's arm is considered rude. By comparison, in the high-contact cultures of the Middle East, Latin America, and southern Europe, physical touch is a big part of socializing.
Naturally, these different standards of contact can lead to misunderstanding. An Argentinian may see a Scandinavian as cold, while the Scandinavian may see the Argentinian as impolite.
In most Western countries, frequent eye contact is a sign of confidence and attentiveness. But in many Asian, African, and Latin American countries, however, unbroken eye contact would be considered rude. These cultures tend to pay more attention to hierarchy , and avoiding eye contact is a sign of respect for bosses and elder. In these parts of the world, children won't look at an adult who is speaking to them, and nor will employees to their bosses.","{

"Let Children Roam  Free
Everyone agrees that playing outside keeps children thinner. The loss of opportunities for outdoor play is one of the main causes of childhood obesity. What is more remarkable is the growing evidence that children's mental health and emotional well-being are enhanced by contact with the outdoors, and that the restorative  effect appears to be strongest in natural settings. Researchers are convinced of the depth of the connection between children's well-being and the environment, claiming that contact with nature may be as important to children as good nutrition and adequate sleep.
But now children seem to get less touch with outdoor activities. The root causes of the dramatic loss of children's freedom lie in changes to the very fabric of their lives over the last 30 years or so. The growth in road traffic, alongside poor town planning and shifts in the make-up and daily rhythms of families and communities, have left children with fewer outdoor places to go. These changes coincided with the ""culture of fear"": a generalized anxiety about all imaginary kinds of threats, even though children are statistically safer from harm now than at any point in human history.
These physical, economic and social changes and fears have been made use of by manufactures and advertisers, whose products and messages both reinforce the logic of keeping children virtual prisoners, and force us to compensate them in the only way our cash-rich, time-poor society seems to know: by spending money on them.
Government must bear some of the blame for keeping children prisoners indoor, through their promotion of planning policies that favour cars over communities and profit over people. The real planning crimes lie in housing companies occupying attractive parks and green spaces, and in town plans that force families to depend largely on their cars. There is no doubt that traffic danger, unlike stranger danger, is a real threat to children and a constant worry for parents. 
Around 100 child pedestrians  are killed every year, a figure that puts the UK near the bottom of Europe's child road safety league. It is no surprise that figures show a steady fall in children walking or cycling over the last twenty years, to the extent that while over 90% of children own a bicycle, just 2% cycle to school. Also, 30% of children aged eight to ten never play outside without an adult watching over them.
In a single generation, the ""home habitat"" of a typical eight-year-old----the area in which children are able to travel on their own- has shrunk to one-ninth of its former size. Health experts have even created a new word, ""obesogenic"", to describe those aspects of our lives that make us fat, and top of the list is the design of streets, towns and cities.","{

"Warren Buffett , probably the world's most successful investor , has said that anything good that happened to him could be traced back to the fact that he was born in the right country , the United States , at the right time (1930) . In 1988 , when The World light-heartedly ranked 50 countries according to where would be the best place to be born in 1988 , America indeed came top . But which country will be the best for a baby born in 2015 ?
To answer this , the Economist Intelligence Unit ( EIU ) , has this time turned deadly serious . It attempts to measure which country will provide the best opportunities for a healthy , safe and prosperous life in the years ahead . Its quality-of-life index links the results of subjective life-satisfaction surveys - how happy people say they are - to objective determinants of the quality of life . Being rich helps more than anything else , but it is not all that counts ; things like crime , trust in public institutions and the health of family life matter too . In all , the index takes 11 significant factors into account .
Despite the global economic crisis , times have in certain respects never been so good . Output growth rates have been decreasing across the world , but income levels are at or near historic highs , Life expectancy continues to increase steadily and political freedoms have become better known across the globe .
What does all this mean for where a baby might be luckiest to be born in 2015 ? After calculation , the EIU has Switzerland comfortably in the top spot , with Australia second . Small economies occupy the top ten . Half of these are European , but only one , the Netherlands , is from the euro zone . The largest European economies ( Germany , France and Britain ) do not do particularly well . America , where babies will inherit the large debts of the boomer generation , stays in 16th place . Among the 80 countries covered , Nigeria comes last .
Some people will , of course , find more holes in all this than there are in a big Swiss cheese . For example , in the film "" The Third Man "" , Harry Lime famously says that Italy for 30 years had war , terror and murder under the Borgias but in that time produced Michelangelo , Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance ; Switzerland had 500 yeas of peace and democracy -- and produced clocks and watches .
However , there is surely a lot to be said for birth stability in today's uncertain times .","{

"Do you plan to study at American University ?It takes a long time to get accepted at most
American schools,perhaps as much as a year.That's why you should start choosing a school as soon as possible.It's also a good idea to apply to several different schools,so that you'll have a better chance of being accepted at one. You should start looking for information now ,because the more  information you have about each college,the better choice you can make.
There are two good ways to get information you need.One is a general reference book,called Guide to American Colleges and Universities.The other good source of information is the catalogue published by each school.
You can study the general guide in almost any American library.This book has a lot of useful
information,such as the number of students,the average test score for people accepted to the school,and the number of books in the library.You can also find the address of each school in this book.
Although the general guidebook has helpful information,some of the facts may be out-of-date.For example,many school raise their tuition every year.Since you'll need to know what your education will cost,out-of-date information will not be good enough.To be sure that you are getting the latest information,write to the university and ask for its catalogue.The catalogue not only has more detailed information.For example,the catalogue can tell you what kinds of courses are offered,and what kind housing there is in the school.Some universities have places for you to live in,but at  others you have to find your own place to live.

"In the last 500 years nothing about people--not their clothes, ideas, or languages has changed as much as what they eat. Chocolate   drink was first made from the seeds of the cacao   tree by South American Indians. The Spanish introduced it to the rest of the world during the 1500s. And although it was very expensive, it quickly became popular, In London, shops where chocolate drinks were served became important places. Some still exist today. The potato is also from the New World. Around 1600, the Spanish brought it from Peru to Europe, where it soon was widely grown. Ireland became so dependent   on it that thousands of Irish people starved   when the crop failed during the years of 1845--1846, and thousands more were forced to go to live in America.
There are many other foods that have traveled from South America to the Old World. But some others went in the opposite direction.

In the early years of the 20th century, the boll weevil   began destroying the cotton farms in the southern USA.
In May 1910, folks all over the nation were talking about Halley's Comet  . There were all sorts of frightening stories about it, the main one being that the world would pass through its tail, said to be millions of miles long.
Between the threats of the comet and weevils, the farmers were running low on optimism. One night, they gathered at our farm to discuss what to do. Will Bowen, a local man, suggested, ""Charley, how about giving us a little music?""
""I don't think anybody'd want to hear me tonight,"" Dad replied.
""Come on, Mr. Nordyke,"" one of the younger women urged. ""Play for us!""
Dad got the hang of getting people in the mood for his music. He played church songs, and then switched to war songs. By the time he had finished performing, people were stamping their feet, clapping their hands and yelling.
All of our neighbors went home whistling. Very few remembered to look to see whether the comet was still around.
Another evening, Will Bowen called Dad on the telephone and said, ""Charley, I'm downhearted and blue. Could you play a tune or two for me through the phone?""
Dad handed the receiver to me and then set about playing the songs he had performed that night. I could hear Mr. Bowen whistling and yelling.
By the time the tune was finished there were half a dozen neighbors on the line. They talked about how wonderful the music sounded over the telephone. They made numerous requests; I relayed them to Dad and he played.
Our broadcasts became regular features of community life. When the weather was bad in winter and farmers were forced to remain in the house, someone would ring us and ask Dad to play.

"Listening to a radio broadcast in a foreign language is difficult for many of us. We may have studied the language for several years, and are able to read it, perhaps even write in it. But listening and understanding the spoken language require special skills. Some people have a natural ability that helps them to learn a language quickly, while others must study for a long time. Everyone, however, can improve his or her listening skills with practice.
We are good listeners in our own language because we have had years of practice. We understand the grammar and the language. We know what to expect a person to say to us in almost any situation. We have been in similar situations many times, and we have heard it all before. We can understand it, even if we do not listen carefully.
But this is not true with a foreign language. We must listen with our full attention. And we must try not to let the cultural style of our language affect our understanding of the foreign language. Listening to a foreign language broadcast is easier if we know something about it. There are clues that can help us. One clue is the time of a day. Morning programs usually contain many short items of news, information or entertainment. The items are short because most of us are getting ready to go to work in the morning. Often we do not have time to listen to long programs. Evening programs are different. There is time for more details about the subjects discussed.
We can get a clue about the program from the music at the beginning, but we must be familiar with the music of the foreign culture. The kind of music--serious and slow, or fast and light--can tell us what kind of program to expect. The name of the program can give us good information about what it will contain.
Another good clue is the broadcaster. The more we listen to the same person, the easier it will be to understand him. His speaking style will become familiar to us. Further, the broadcaster provides clues to the organization of the broadcast at the beginning of the program. The broadcaster usually gives us the highlights of the program to prepare us for the details that will follow.","{

"I received pictures of my daughter floating   on a lake in California. Right there under the sun during the hottest time of the day, she has only her swimsuit to cover her.
When I showed it to my students, it was as if I had shown them scenes from a horror   movie.
""But she will get dark,"" they said.
""That's what she wants,"" I told them. ""We think darker skin   is beautiful.""
They looked at me in disbelief. It was as if I came from the moon.
For years, American girls spend their summer trying to get as tanned   as possible. In China, on the other hand, girls use umbrellas all year round.
What in the world is going on?
The pale skin we think looks unattractive   is what Asian women want. Both groups want to meet their culture's standard   of beauty.
In the US, if you can afford to go on vacation in the summer, you head for a river, a lake or a beach, where you try to get as much sun as possible. If you are rich you take a winter vacation in some sunny spot. Your winter tan shows your wealth.
In China, once upon a time, the few wealthy were the ones who didn't have to work out in the hot sun. So the whiter the skin, the richer the woman. The folk opera performers who play these ladies wore lots of white makeup  . The tradition survives to this day.
So it comes naturally that none of my students wishes to follow the Western ways in this regard.

"It's been seven days since a 7. 0-magnitude strong earthquake hit Ya'an, in Sichuan Province. How the earthquake has affected one of Sichuan Province's special residents--pandas. How are the animals coping? And do they have enough food to eat? 
There are more than 80 pandas living here at the Chengdu Panda Breeding Base. 7 baby pandas have just left their mothers and have begun to learn how to fend for themselves. 
The quake was felt strongly in Chengdu. Fortunately, all of the pandas here were out on the grounds when the earthquake hit, so they were very safe. Although no deaths or injuries have been reported among the Baoxing panda population so far, they've been badly frightened by the earthquake. Several days has passed and the earthquake seems to have made no discernible negative impact on the pandas. These two baby pandas Chengshuang and Chengdui are play fighting with each other and climbing trees. When they climbed too high, the breeders have to rescue them from the trees. 
The visitors are amused by the scenes and think it's like a fantastic acrobatics show. 
The quake zone is not only the home of these pandas, it's also the source of their food. Fortunately, enough bamboo has been stored away in five bamboo storehouses for the pandas, so there are no worries with regard to food supplies. 
Wu Kongju, Breeder, Chengdu Panda Breeding Base, said, ""When the Wenchuan earthquake happened in 2008, we were unprepared and had a shortage of bamboo. But we've been able to handle this earthquake event more smoothly. There are no problems with the food supply. ""Apart from the pandas' favorite Baijia Bamboo, breeders also give them bamboo shoots, which are very rich in nutrients.

"Searching for airfares   often seems like a game that passengers are bound to lose.
Prices change from day to day, even minute to minute. Looking through multiple websites for the best deal can be a big challenge. Even when you do book, there's no guarantee that you are going to get the best price.
""You just don't know when to _ . It's not like buying anything else I can think of,"" said George Hobica, founder of Airfarewatchdog.com.
Harriet Levy paid $179 for a recent round-trip flight on American Airlines between New York and Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Sitting just one row behind her, Shirley Harrison paid $215. A few rows back, Ellis and Dianne Traub paid $317 each. There were at least 12 fares on the flight, ranging from $169 to $360.
There's no reason for it, Harrison said.
Fares can fluctuate significantly in just a few hours. One Delta flight from New York to Los Angeles jumped from $755 to $1,143 from a Friday to Saturday in late April, then fell to $718 on Sunday.
The flight was one of a dozen the Associated Press followed over three months for a vacation between July 16 and 22. The number one finding: avoid booking tickets on weekends. It's the most expensive time to buy.
There's no way to guarantee the best fare. But before booking, travelers should pay attention to this additional advice:
* Book on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday. That's when airlines most often offer sales.
* Buy in advance, but not too early. The best time is four to six weeks before traveling. In general, prices for any given flight are highest eight to 10 weeks and two to three weeks in advance.
* Make use of social media. Airlines are giving more benefits like exclusive   sales to travelers who interact   with them on Twitter and Facebook. Those specials are often gone within hours.
* The so-called discount   airlines - JetBlue, Air-Tran, Southwest and Frontier - adjust their fares less frequently than other airlines, so you can feel more confident that the price will stay the same.

"""It hurts me more than you"", and ""This is for your own good"" --these are the statements my mother used to make years ago when I had to learn Latin, clean my room, stay home and do homework.
That was before we entered the permissive period in education in which we decided it was all right not to push our children to achieve their best in school. The schools and the educators made it easy for us. They taught that it was all right to be parents who take a let-alone policy. We stopped making our children do homework. We gave them calculators, turned on the television, left the teaching to the teachers and went on vacation.
Now teachers, faced with children who have been developing at their own pace for the past 15 years, are realizing we've made a terrible mistake. One such teacher is Sharon Clomps who says of her students--""so passive"" --and wonders what has happened. Nothing is demanded of them, she believes. Television, says Clomps, contributes to children's passivity. ""We're talking about a generation of kids who' vet never been hurt or hungry. They have learned somebody will always do it for them, instead of saying 'go and look it up', you tell them the answer. It takes greater energy to say no to a kid.""
Yes, it does. It takes energy and it takes work. It's time for parents to end their vacation and come back to work. It' s time to take the car away, to turn the TV off, to tell them it hurts you more than them but it' s for their own good. It's s time to start telling them no again.","{

"The famous English writer, Charles Dickens, is on every British child's school reading list. Though Dickens is one of England's greatest writers, he is not often read. Most people do not read his books because they think they are too long and the language he uses is old-fashioned  . Television, however, has rescued this great English writer from disappearing in the modern age.
In the UK for several years, Dickens' novels have been turned into exciting television dramas. His latest book to be filmed is his little known story Little Dorrit. Before the story became a 15-part television drama most Britons were unaware   that Dickens had ever written it.
Most of the Dickens television dramas are so well filmed that English students are likely to watch them in class while studying his book. There are, however, some differences between the books and television dramas. The television dramas often give more time to the exciting parts of Dickens' books. For example, there is far more kissing scenes in the television shows than there are in the books.
Some television dramas have also slightly changed Dickens' female characters to make them more acceptable to a modern audience  . In Dickens' books his females are often weak and emotional. The TV dramas, however, show them as being fairly independent-minded.
Several TV critics   have argued that Dickens' stories are actually better suited to television than they are being read as books. Their reasoning is that Dickens wrote his stories for newspapers. A chapter   would appear in the newspaper each week so Dickens ended each chapter at an exciting moment. People then would buy the newspaper the following week to find out what happened later. This makes his stories perfect for being shown on television as 15-part programs.","{

"Sandra Bullock turned 51 last month. But because she looks exactly the same as she did inMiss Congeniality, a movie filmed back in the 20thcentury, everyone calls her ""ageless."" Bullock is just one of a number of stars in their 40s and 50s who've had birthdays recently but have not gotten older, unlike the rest of us in their age group. Take Halle Berry. One website put a photo of her 20 years ago next to one of the newly 49-year-old Berry and dared us to choose which was which. ""This Is What 49 Looks Like,"" it said. Seriously, if that's what 49 looks like, I must be 71.
However, even a generation ago, famous faces evolved. Look at a picture of Grace Kelly at age 52 in the early 1980s. She looks like a beautiful middle-aged woman. Today she'd look old for her age.
The goal now is to prevent aging while you are still young, using all the magical nonsurgical options medicine has to offer. Eventually these techniques will become less expensive, and ordinary people my daughter's age will have them. Already anti-aging is starting to be considered maintenance, like coloring your hair. My friends and I find ourselves openly debating techniques that we used to make fun of. Does fat-freezing work? How much time do you have to spend in the gym to keep the body of a 35-year-old after 50? It's all so exhausting. But members of the next generation have it tougher. They'll have to ask themselves whether they want to spend their youth trying not to get old. I've already seen ""Sexy at 70"" headlines. Will everyone be expected to go to their graves  looking hot?

"Mothers can still offer comfort, even from a distance, a new study has found. The results show that simply hearing their mothers' voice over the phone works just as well at calming the nerves of stressed children as a real-life pat on the shoulder.
The soothing effect is most likely due to the release of the hormone , oxytocin , in the brain, the researchers say. This ""love hormone"" is known to _ stress and is likely to be involved in social connections, including those between a mother and a child.
Previous work has revealed that this hormone is released during physical contact with a mother. ""But it's clear from these results that a mother's voice can have the same effect as a hug, even if she isn't actually standing there,"" said the researcher, Leslie Seltzer, a biological scientist.
Seltzer tested a group of 61 girls, aged 7 to 12, by having them make an unprepared speech and solve a series of maths problems in front of a group of strangers, sending their hearts racing and levels of cortisol--a hormone associated with stress--soaring.
Facing a challenge like that raises stress levels of a lot of people. Once stressed, a third of the girls were comforted in person by their mothers with hugs. A third of the girls watched an emotionally neutral 75-minute video. The rest were handed a telephone with their mothers on the line.
For the girls who interacted in person or over the phone with their mothers, the levels of the ""love hormone"" rose significantly, and the stress-marking hormone was washed away. This effect didn't show up for participants who watched the video.
Seltzer is now testing the amount of oxytocin released with other communication methods--like text messaging--and hopes to see the research spread out from human subjects. ""It's not just us, of course. Lots of very social species have voices,"" she said. ""on the one hand, we are curious to see if this effect is unique to humans. On the other, we're hoping researchers who study vocal communication will consider looking at oxytocin release in other animals and apply it to broader questions of social behavior and evolutionary biology.","{

"In my procession as an educator and health care provider, I have worked with numerous children infected with the virus that causes AIDS. The relationships that I have had with these special kids have been gifts in my life. They have taught me so many things, but I have especially learned that great courage can be found in the smallest of packages. Let me tell you about Tyler.
Tyler was born infected with HIV: his mother was also infected. From the very beginning of his life, he was dependent on medications to enable him to survive. When he was five, he had a tube surgically inserted in a vein in his chest. This tube was connected to a pump, which he carried in a small backpack on his back. Medications were hooked up to this pump and were continuously supplied through this tube to his bloodstream. At times, he also needed supplemented oxygen to support his breathing.
Tyler wasn't willing to give up one single moment of his childhood to this deadly disease. It was not unusual to find him playing and racing around his backyard, wearing his medicine-laden backpack and dragging his tank of oxygen behind him in his little wagon. All of us who knew Tyler marveled at his pure joy in being alive and the energy it gave him. Tyler's mom often teased him by telling him that he moored so fast she needed to dress him in red. That way, when she peered through the window to check on him playing in the yard, she round quickly spot him.
This dreaded disease eventually wore down even the likes of a little dynamo like Tyler. He grew quite ill and, unfortunately, so did his HIV-infected mother. When it became apparent that he wasn't going to survive, Tyler's mom talked to him about death. She comforted him by telling Tyler that she was dying too, and that she would be with him soon in heaven.
A few days before his death, Tyler beckoned me over to his hospital bed and whispered, ""I might die soon. I'm not scared. When I die, please dress me in red. Mom promised she's coming to heaven, too. I'll be playing when she gets there, and I want to make sure she can find me.""","{

"Snow-melting Agent
A heavy snow can kill pests and this means a good harvest next year.This will bring as well as trouble to urbanites.
On Nov.16,2003,a cold air current brought a heavy snow to Beijing.To prevent traffic jams,related government departments mobilized people to clear off snow on streets.
One of the most effective ways to clear off snow on roads is to scatter snow-melting agent on the roads.The major component of the snow-melting agent is salt.The snow-melting agent can make snow stop from freezing,make it easier to clear off the road,and allow traffic to flow smoothly.But it also brings about some hidden dangers.In the spring of 2003,over 300 000 trees in Beijing urban districts died.After analyzing soil around these trees,experts discovered that the salt content of these soils was 392 times higher than normal.Where did the excessive salt come from?After investigating,forestry experts found that when clearing snow in the winter,people usually heap snow containing snow-melting agent at trees' roots,and that when the snow melts,this agent penetrates the soil and increases its salt content.The snow-melting agent indirectly killed the trees.
Statistics show that during a heavy snow in 2002,over 1000 tons of snow-melting agent was scatterred on streets in Beijing.Snow water containing a large amount of snow-melting agent got into the soil through sewers.
In addition,salt in the snow-melting agent can expedite the corrosion of steel bars in concrete buildings and cause the concrete to crack and peel,shortening the life of roads.
Scientists and government officials are required to solve traffic problems caused by heavy snows as soon as possible and at the same time try to reduce the negative effects of the snow-melting agent.This is a difficult problem placed before them.Related authorities have framed some local criteria to regulate the production and use of snow-melting agents.
Now,more harmless snow-melting agents are being developed.Now that even snow-melting agents that meet today's criteria must still be used carefully,we have to rely more on our manpower and machines to clear off snow.
This year,in addition to using snow-melting agents,Beijing will use a large number of snow vehicles to clear snow on roads.In more places,citizens are mobilized to clear snow with their hands.This may be a test of a city's civilization level.","{

"Most penguins died after a huge iceberg grounded near their habitat in Antarctica,forcing them to make a long way to find food, scientists say in a newly published study. The B09B iceberg, measuring about 100 square kilometers, grounded in Commonwealth Bay in East Antarctica in December 2010, the researchers from Australia and New Zealand wrote in the ""Antarctic Science"" journal.
The Adelie penguin population at the bay's Cape Denison was measured to be about 160,000 in February 2011 but by December 2013 it had decreased to about 10,000, they said. The iceberg's grounding meant the penguins had to walk more than 60 kilometers to find food, preventing their breeding attempts, said the researchers from the University of New South Wales' ( UNSW) Climate Change Research Centre and New Zealand's West Penguin Trust.
""The Cape Denison population could disappear completely within 20 years unless B09B relocates or the fast ice within the bay breaks out,""they wrote in the research published in. Fast ice is sea ice which forms and stays along the coast. During their survey in December 2013 , the researchers said ""hundreds of abandoned eggs were noted, and the freeze-dried dead bodies of previous season's little penguins lay everywhere on the ground.""
""It's strangely silent,""UNSW's Chris Turney , who led the 2013 exploration , told the""Sydney Morning Herald Friday"".""The ones that we saw at Cape Denison were terribly low-spirited , almost unaware of your existence . The ones that are surviving are clearly struggling. They can hardly survive themselves , let alone give birth to the next generation. We saw lots of dead birds on the ground.""
In contrast, penguins living on the eastern edge of the bay just 8 kilometers from the fast ice edge were full of _ , the scientists said. The researchers said the study had important influence on the wider East Antarctic if the current situation of increasing sea ice continued. Sea ice around Antarctica is increasing, in contrast to the Arctic where global warming is causing ice to melt and icebergs to decrease. Scientists believe the growth in Antarctic sea ice is likely to be driven by changes in wind and local conditions before long.","{

"Geoffery Payne talked for the first time about the night when his wife was killed. The judge thought it was he who killed his wife. Now he wrote to a magazine from the prison about what had happened on the night of 13 October, 2007.
I had to stay late at the hospital that night to do an operation. I finally left at about 11 p.m. I drove home slowly because the weather was terrible- the wind was blowing and it was raining heavily. I was turning into our road when a man suddenly ran in front of my car. I almost hit him but I stopped just in time. I was frightened and the man looked frightened, too. I got out of the car but he ran away before I could ask if he was all right. It was strange.
When I got home, the lights were on but it was very quiet. I called to my wife but there was no answer. Then I remembered that she was out at a concert.
I was still very upset about what had happened on the road, so I made myself a drink. Then I went upstairs to have a bath. I saw that the window in the bedroom was open. This was strange because my wife always locked the doors and windows before she went out. She was afraid of burglars  . When I went to close the window, I found Ellen. She was lying on the floor. There was blood everywhere. I rushed over and felt her pulse but she was dead. I sat on the floor beside her body. I was too frightened to do anything.
When I gained a bit of consciousness, the sky was getting light. I couldn't remember a thing about the night. In the morning I phoned the police. They arrived about half an hour after I phoned them. But it seemed like hours. During that time I tried hard to recall what had happened the night before. I couldn't stop thinking about the man on the road. What was he doing at that time of night in our quiet neighborhood? Why did he look so frightened? Why did he run away?","{

"For eighty four days old Santiago had not caught a single fish. At first a young boy, Manolin, had shared his bad fortune, but after the fortieth luckless day the boy's father told his son to go in another boat. From that time on, Santiago worked alone. The boy loved the old fisherman and always helped him with money and food. Usually, they would talk about the fish they had taken in luckier times or about American baseball after supper, while at night, alone in his cottage, Santiago dreamed of lions on the beaches of Africa, where he had gone years before. _ 
On the eighty-fifth day, Santiago set off to fish before dawn. Two of his baits  were fresh tunas  the boy had given him, as well as sardines  to cover his hooks. Then he set his lines which went straight down into deep dark water.
As the sun rose he saw other boats in toward shore. A bird showed him where dolphins were chasing some flying fish. This time Santiago saw tuna jumping in the sunlight. A small one took the hook on his line. Pulling the fish aboard, the old man thought it a good fortune.
Toward noon a marlin, a common fish in the sea, started eating the bait which was one hundred meters down. Gently the old man played the fish, a big one, as he knew from the weight on the line. At last he struck to settle the hook. The fish did not come out of the surface. Instead, it began to pull the boat to the northwest. The old man followed it. _ 
It was cold after the sunset. When something took one of his remaining baits, he cut the line with his knife. Once the marlin leaned suddenly, pulling Santiago forward on his face and cutting his cheek. By dawn his left hand was cramped . The fish had headed northward; there was no land in sight. Hungry, he cut pieces from the tuna and chewed them slowly.
That morning the fish jumped. Seeing it, Santiago knew he had hooked the biggest marlin he had ever seen. Then the fish went down and turned toward the east. Santiago drank a little water from the bottle during the hot afternoon.
Close to nightfall a dolphin took the small hook he had rebaited. He lifted it aboard, careful. After he had rested, he cut meat from the dolphin and kept also the two flying fish he found in its stomach. That night he slept. He awoke to feel the line running through his fingers as the fish jumped. Feeding line slowly, he tried to tire the marlin. After the fish slowed its run, he washed his cut hands in sea water and ate one of the flying fish. At sunrise the marlin began to circle. Faint, he worked to bring the big fish nearer with each turn. _ The fish was two feet longer than the boat. No fish like it had ever been seen in Havana harbor.
An hour later, he sighted the first shark, a fierce Mako, and it came in fast to chase after the dead marlin. The old man struck the shark with his harpoon. The Mako rolled and sank, carrying the harpoon with it and leaving the marlin bloody. He knew the smell would spread. Watching, he saw two sharks closing in. He struck at one with his knife and watched it sliding down into deep water. The other he killed while it tore at the flesh of the marlin. When the third appeared, he thrust  it with the knife. The other sharks came at sunset. At first he tried to beat them with the tiller  from the boat, but his hands were bleeding and there were too many in the sea. In the darkness, as he steered toward the harbor of Havana, he heard them hitting the boat again and again. But the old man thought only of his steering and his great tiredness. He had gone out too far and the sharks had beaten him. He knew they would leave him nothing but the stripped skeleton of the big marlin.
All lights were out when he sailed into the little harbor and beached his boat. He could just make out the white backbone and the upstanding tail of the fish. _ In his cottage he fell on his bed and went to sleep.","{

"School uniforms are becoming more and more popular across the U.S.A. That's no surprise,because they offer many benefits. They immediately end the powerful social sorting and labeling  that come from clothing. If all students are dressed in the same way,they will not pay too much attention to their clothing,and some of them will not be laughed at for wearing the ""wrong"" clothes.
Some people are against the strict rule of school uniforms,but they do not realize that students already accept a kind of rule -- wanting to look just like their friends. The difference is that the clothing students choose for themselves creates social barriers ; school uniforms tear those barriers down.
As in other places,uniforms remind the wearers of their purposes and duties. For example,when a man or woman puts on a police uniform,he or she becomes,for a time,the symbol of law and order. The uniform means to the wearer his or her special duties and sends the same message to everyone the wearer meets. People with different jobs wear uniforms of one kind or another. For students,the school uniform reminds them that their task for the six or seven hours they are in school is to get an education.
Some parents are unhappy about uniforms,saying that school uniforms will affect their children's ""creativity"". First,as noted above,the clothes students choose to wear do not necessarily express their individuality  . They just copy their classmates. Second,students have the rest of the day to be as creative as they like. While they're in school,their job is to master reading,writing,and maths; this should take up all the creativity they have. Mastery of those skills will be good for the students to build up their creativity in every way.","{

"Most people think that the capital of the movie world is Hollywood in the United States. However, the real movie capital is Mumbai, in India. Mumbai used to be known as Bombay, and so the film industry there is called ""Bollywood."" Bollywood makes twice as many movies each year as Hollywood--more than 800 films a year.
The movies from Bollywood are very different from Hollywood movies. For one thing, Bollywood movies are much longer than most Hollywood movies. Most Bollywood movies are more than three hours long, and contain singing, dancing, action, adventure, mystery and romance (but usually no kissing). Because Bollywood films contain so many different features, this style of film is sometimes called a ""masala"" film. (""Masala"" is an Indian word for a mixture of species.)
Another big difference between Bollywood and Hollywood movies is the way movies are made. It takes much longer to make a movie in Hollywood than in Bollywood. In fact, filming may begin on a Bollywood movie before the script is finished. The director and writer can make up the story while the film is being made. Sometimes they will even write the script   by hand instead of taking time to type it.
Bollywood actors are very popular and some are in such high demand that they may work on several movies at the same time. They may even shoot  scenes for several films on the same day using the same costumes and scenery. Since most Bollywood movies follow the same kind of story, shooting scenes for several films at the same time is not a big problem for actors or directors. This also helps keep the cost of Bollywood movies lower than the cost of Hollywood movies. The average Bollywood film, with a budget of only two million US dollars, seems very cheap compared to the average budget of sixty million US dollars for a Hollywood film, thirty times as much!","{

"Television will turn 86 years old on September 7, 2013, and it has never looked better. In its youth, television was a piece of furniture with a tiny, round screen showing unclear pictures of  lowbudget programs. In spite of its shortcomings, it became well-received. Between 1950 and 1963, the number of American families with a television jumped from 9% to 92% of the population.
As the audience got larger, the technology got better. Television sets became more reliable through the 1960s. Both of the reception and the picture improved. The major networks started broadcasting programs in color.
Even greater improvements were coming according to Sanford Brown, who wrote an article forthe Postin 1967. Surprisingly, just about every prediction he made in the article became a reality. For example: All sets in the notdistant future will be color instruments. He also predicted that TV sets would become smaller, simpler, more reliable and less expensive and may forever put the TV repairman out of work. Smaller sets do not, of course, mean smaller screens. TV engineers expect screens to get much bigger. However, today's 3D TV is even farther away, if it's coming at all.  There is some doubt whether the public would be eager to pay for it, in view of people's cold reception given to 3D movies.
But the technology with the greatest potential, according to Brown, was cable television  , which was still in its early stages then. As he predicted, the future of cable television was highly interactive. It wasn't cable television that gave Americans their electronic connection to the world, however. It was the Internet.  He even foresaw the future office: using picture phones, bigscreen televisions for conferences, and computers providing information, at the touch of a button.
Brown ever said, ""The future of television is no longer a question of what we can invent. It's a question of what we want.""","{

"Students at the Yale School of Architecture handed over the keys to a house that they designed and built to its new owners at a ceremony on Sept. 25 at 20 King Place.
The ceremony held to hand over the house will mark the completion of the school's First-Year Building Project 2008. since 1967, the Yale School of Architecture has offered its first-year graduate students the opportunity to design and build a structure as a part of their education. Unique among architecture schools, this program is compulsory for all members of the class, and students frequently refer to it as their reason for applying to Yale.
This year's class of 64 worked to design, develop and document an idea for a 2,100-square-foot, wheelchair-accessible, two-family house. Students had to use sustainable resources and energy-efficient technology. The budget for the project is always less than actual construction costs, and the builders-in-training had to seek supplementary donations, mostly in the form of construction materials.
The result this year was a ""designer"" home, dressed entirely in cedar , fitted inside with Swedish-designed cabinetry  and partially powered by solar energy. The floors are bamboo, another natural material prized for being quickly replenished . This year, the student-builders used a pre-cast foundation system, which, in addition to its other labor-saving virtues, uses 75% less concrete than the poured system. The first-year class of 2008 raised $100,000-worth of donated materials. But when it came to constructing the inside steps of the house, they used old drafting tables from the School of Architecture that would otherwise have been thrown out.

"People usually hate mice, but people almost all over the world like one mouse-- the famous Mickey Mouse.
About eighty years ago, most films had no sounds. A man called Walt Disney made a cartoon mouse. The cartoon mouse could talk in these films. He made his mouse become a good friend of both young people and old people. Children liked to see their lovely friend, because he brought happiness to them.
Mickey is a clean mouse right from the beginning. Maybe this is why people love Mickey Mouse very much. In his early life, Mickey did some wrong things. People were very angry. They wrote to Disney and said they didn't want Mickey to do the wrong things. Because there were some things that Mickey could not do. Disney made a new animal called Donald Duck.

"The Teens & Self-Image survey organized by USA WEEKEND attracted an unprecedented  272,400. The majority of teens say they feel good about themselves, but many express misgivings  about who they are, especially about their appearance.

It is found that problems typically associated with girls are now becoming more visible in boys. Teen respondents believe good looks matter when it comes to personal achievement, specifically making friends, winning the respect of others, and succeeding in life.
    Teens find lots of imperfections. Almost 85 percent cite ways they'd like to improve. After losing weight and toning up , the top three are their grades, doing better in sports, and having a better relationship with their parents. Only 15 percent like themselves ""the way I am.""

And 1 in 3 have friends who have talked about or actually tried to commit suicide--the third leading cause of death among 15 to 24-year-olds. Last year, about 2,000 teens committed suicide, and the rate of adolescent suicide has greatly increased in the past 10 years, studies show.
    Teens show a healthy self-respect. Asked to choose from a list of qualities, 8 in 10 say they are kind, 3 in 4 say they are honest, and 7 in 10 say they have a good sense of humor. Slightly more than 6 in 10 say they are smart, self-confident or creative. Least admired of a dozen qualities they were asked to rank: being popular, rich or tough.","{

"I watched a little girl playing basketball every day from my bedroom window. One day, I asked her why she practiced so much. She said, ""I want to go to college. The only way I can go is to get a scholarship . I like basketball and I want to be the best player in college. My dad told me, ""If the dream is big enough, the facts don't count."" She never changed her mind. Whenever she was in junior high school or senior high school. One day, before she graduate from senior high school, I saw her sitting on the grass sadly. I asked her what was wrong. She told me that her coach said she was too short to be a good basketball player, so she should stop dreaming about going to college. She was heartbroken and it made me feel bad, too. Then she smiled and told me her father said to her, ""If you really want to play for the scholarship of a good college, nothing but yourself can stop your dream."" The next year, she and her team went to a big game she was seen by a coach of a famous college team and was offered a scholarship to the women's basketball team of their college.

"Once an Englishman named Jack Brown went to Russia for a holiday. He stayed there for several months and then came home again. Some of his friends visited him a few days after he got back. ""I had a very dangerous trip while I was in Russia,"" Jack said to them. ""I wanted to see a friend of mine in the country and the bad weather made me very late. So I was still traveling through a forest in a sleigh  when the sun went down. It was a long way from my friend's house when about twenty wolves began to follow my sleigh. It was very dark in the forest. There was thick snow on the ground. It was cold, and there were no houses for miles and miles. First I heard the wolves. The noise was terrible! The horses heard them, too. They were frightened and began running faster. Then I saw long, gray forms among the trees, and soon the wolves were near us. They were running very fast, and they didn't seem to get tired like the horses.""
""What did you do?"" one of Jack's friends asked.
""When the wolves got very near,"" Jack answered, ""I put up my gun and shot the first wolf. The sleigh was moving about, but I hit the animal and killed it. Then all the other wolves stopped and ate it, so our sleigh got away from them for a few minutes.""
""Then they finished their meal, and I heard them coming again. The moon was shining brightly on the snow now, and after a few minutes I saw them running among the trees once more. They came nearer again, and then I shot another of them, and the others stopped once more to eat it.""
""The same thing happened again and again, and my horses became more and more tired and ran slower and slower until, after about two hours, only one wolf was still alive and following us.""

"Today almost everyone knows computers and the Internet. If I ask you ""What is the most important thing in your life?"" may be you will say ""Computers and the Internet"".
The first computer was made in 1946. It was very big but it worked slowly.. Today, computers are getting smaller, and smaller, but they work faster and faster. What can computers do? A writer has said, ""People can't live without computers today.""21cnjy.com
The Internet came a little later than computers. It is about twenty-five years later than computers. But now it can be found almost everywhere. We can use it to read books, send e-mails, do some shopping, play games or make friends.               21*cnjy*com
Young men, especially the middle school students like the Internet very much. They often go into the Internet bars as soon as they are free. They make friends on the Internet and maybe they have never seen these friends. They don't know their names, ages and sex . They are so interested in making the ""unreal friends"" that they can't put their heart into study. Some of them play the games in the Internet bars all day and all night. Many of them can't catch up with others in many subjects because of that.
Now the government has done many things. Some gangster Internet bars have been banned . But that's not enough. The teachers and parents are still worrying about their students and children.

"I want to talk about the economy.Not ""the economy"" we hear about endlessly in the news each day and in politicians' speeches.I want to talk about the real economy, the one we live in day by day.
Most people aren't particularly interested in ""the economy"".""Share prices are flying high; interest rates are soaring;  the Dow Jones Index closed sixty-three points down on 8472.35."" We hear this and subconsciously switch off.
Notice that ""the economy"" is not the same as the economy, ""The economy"" is what men in suits play with to make vast personal wealth.The economy is where the rest of us live on a daily basis, earning our living, paying our taxes, and purchasing the necessities of life.
We are supposed to be benefiting from all the advantages of a well-off society.So why do we feel tired and stressed? We have no time for anything other than work, which is ridiculous given the number of labor-saving devices in our lives.Our towns become more and more crowded.We poison our air and seas, and our food is full of chemicals.There's something wrong here.If times were truly good, then you may think we'd all feel optimistic about the future.Yet the majority of us are deeply worried.More than 90 percent of us think we are too concerned about ourselves and not concerned enough about future generations.
The term ""economic expansion"" suggests something desirable, but expansion simply means spending more money.More spending doesn't mean that life is getting better.We all know it often means the opposite - greed, crime, poverty, pollution.More spending merely feeds our whole economic system, which is based on production and consumption.Unless money keeps circulating,  the economy breaks down.If we don't keep consuming,  the whole system goes into stalemate .
How do we break the cycle and make some changes? We need to become far more aware of the results of our actions.We buy clothes that are made in sweat shops by virtual slaves in poor parts of the world.We create mountains of waste.We demand cheap food,  mindless of the fact that it totally lacks taste and is produced using chemicals that poison the land.

"As I stood in a stall   of Beijing's Silk Market, waiting to exchange a silk garment, I watched in amazement as the young vendor   pulled out silk nightgown after nightgown for a foreigner, who sounded like an American, but frankly could have been from any English-speaking Western country.
The man appeared satisfied when she pulled out a bright, purple nightgown and said, ""This one, very good."" and probably asked how much it cost, for the owner pulled out her calculator showing 800. My heart was pounding heavily. After all, I was holding a similar gown in my hand for which I had paid all of 60 yuan ($9.39) just the previous day. I wanted to scream and say, ""Wait, you are _ "". But I just kept silent.
As I moved away from the stall a thousand thoughts flashed in my mind. Should I have just stepped in and stopped it? I may have saved the man but could have brought danger to myself. Maybe I could have pretended to seek help with some English from that man and warned him not to be cheated?
When I told the incident to some of my friends, most seemed to think it was unfortunate but one couldn't fault the vendor. Everyone visiting China knows, or ought to know, that bargaining is a way of life here, they said.
Although I do agree that the man should have been better informed, it just doesn't seem right that the place, to which tourists from all over the world are brought and made to believe is a Mecca   for shopping in Beijing, should be allowed to get away with such daylight robbery.
I still think I should have done something about what I witnessed.","{

"Kids are cool to wear blue jeans and T-shirts today.It is fashionable like that.Fashion refers to the styles of dress that are currently popular.Fashion goes beyond just clothes, though.It's important for some people to wear only the latest fashions and styles.For others, though, keeping up with trends isn't that important.The one thing that stays the same with fashion is this: it always changes!
During the 1960s and 1970s, hippies made bell-bottomed blue jeans popular.Also, in the 1980s, Michael Jackson made parachute pants all the fashion.Now try to find these items in today's clothing stores!
Do you know why fashions change? The answer is probably as simple as the fact that people change.Over time, the new replaces the old.People are influenced greatly by popular culture, including athletes, musicians, movies stars, as well as popular films, television shows, books and music.We are also influenced by the fashion industry's advertising.
The stars of popular culture are always searching for a new angle to maintain their popularity.Often these new angles come in the form of new clothing or hairstyles.When people see these new styles, they often want to imitate their favorite stars.To do so, they seek out the latest fashions to make themselves look like the people they want to imitate.In this way, fashions evolve and change over time.
Clothes have been used to separate people into groups for many years.Even today, brand-name, clothing that is more expensive than other types of clothing can be used by some people to distinguish themselves from others.
Unfortunately, this can often have the effect of distancing certain groups from others.Don't forget that it's always OK to develop your own sense of style that is unique and separate from what the fashion world determines! Stay true to yourself and let your personality--not your clothes--speak for who you are!","{

"A MENTORING   program is giving life changing opportunities to Banbury youth.
Young Inspirations was founded two years ago to provide mentoring sessions for students and unemployed young adults aged 11 to 21.
Alex Goldberg, the program's founder, said; ""We set up Young Inspirations because we wanted to give young people experiences which will potentially be life changing and broaden their outlook.
""We try to create work experience opportunities that will really make a difference to our youth. For example, we've secured internships   with world-famous firms such as Honda.
""At a time of funding cutbacks where schools are finding it more and more difficult to offer this kind of mentoring, it is extremely important that these opportunities are available both to help youth with their school work and grades and to give them opportunities which may help shape their futures. "" Kieran Hepburn, 14, is one of a group of Banbury youth who has benefited from the program so far. In October the Banbury School pupil was accompanied by Young Inspirations staff to Paris where he was an observer at the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization's (UNESCO) International Youth Forum  .
The event was held for young people from around the world, to seek their views on how the future of youth and education should look. Kieran joined several hundred observers mostly in their 20s and was the only UK school pupil to attend the event. Kieran thinks the trip was a life changing experience. "" Before we left I didn't quite know what to make of it but when we got there we didn't stop, it was amazing,"" he said, "" We went to three or four hours of debates each day and then did something cultural each afternoon. ""
The main theme of the forum was how youth can drive change in political and public life. It dealt with issues   such as drug abuse, violence and unemployment.
Kieran said: "" It has really helped me to improve my confidence and social skills as well as my school grades and I was voted most improved pupil at school in August. ""

"The motivation to succeed comes from the burning desire to achieve a purpose. Napoleon Hill wrote, ""whatever the mind of man can conceive   and believe, the mind can achieve.""
A young man asked Socrates   the secrets to success. Socrates told the young man to meet him near the river the next morning.  When they meet, Socrates asked the young man to walk with him towards the river. When the water got up to their necks, Socrates took the young man by surprise and pressed him into the water. The boy struggled  to get out but Socrates was strong and kept him there until the boy stared turning blue. Socrates pulled his head out of the water and the first thing the young man did was to gasp  and take a deep breath of air.

"The scientific world continues to be amazed by the speed of the development of cloning. Some scientists now suggest that the cloning of humans could occur in the near future. Despite the benefits of cloning, however, certain ethical   questions concerning the possible abuse   of cloning have been raised. At the heart of these questions is the idea of humans influencing life in a way that could harm society, either morally or in a real physical sense. Some people object to cloning because it allows scientists to ""act like God"" in the handling of living organisms. 
   The cloning of Dolly raised the debate over this practice to a whole new level. It has become obvious that the technology for cloning Dolly could also be used to clone humans. A person could choose to make two or ten or a hundred copies of himself or herself by the same techniques used with Dolly. An active debate about the morality of cloning humans arises. Some people see benefits from the practice, such as providing a way for parents to produce a new child to replace one dying of a fatal disease. Other people worry about humans taking into their own hands the future of the human race. 
   At the beginning of the twenty-first century, many scientists say the controversy over the ethics of cloning humans is overstressed because of the unpredictability   of cloning in general. While scientists have cloned animals such as sheep, mice, cows, pigs, and goats, fewer than 3 percent of all those cloning efforts have succeeded. The animal clones that have been produced often have health problems. Scientists believe the rapid reprogramming in cloning can introduce random   errors into a clone's DNA. Those errors have altered individual genes in minor ways, and the genetic defects   have led to the development of major medical problems. Some scientists say this should make human cloning out of the question, but others argue that cloning humans may actually be easier and safer than cloning animals. Whatever, I agree that further research in the field of cloning is needed.","{

"On May 29, 1973, Thomas Bradley, a black man, was elected mayor of Los Angeles. Los Angeles is the third largest city in the United States, with a population of three million. About sixteen percent of the city's population are black.
News of this election appeared on the front pages of newspapers everywhere in the United States. Here is how one major newspaper reported the event:
LOS ANGELES ELECTS BRADLEY MAYOR UNSEATING YORTYBLACK WINS 56% OF VOTES
Bradley called his victory over Yorty ""the fulfillment   of a dream"". During his childhood and youth, people had kept telling him, ""You can't do this, you can't go there, because you are a Negro."" Nevertheless he had won a decisive victory over a man who had been won 43.7 percent.
Los Angeles voters have had many opportunities to judge. Thomas Bradley had to form an opinion of him. The son of a poor farmer Texas, he joined the Los Angeles police force in 1940. During his twenty-one years on the police force he earned a law degree by attending school at night. He was elected to the city council   ten years ago.
At the time of the Los Angeles election, three other American cities already had black mayors, but none of those cities had as large a population as Los Angeles. Besides, the percentage of blacks in those other cities was much larger. Cleveland, Ohio, had thirty-six percent black when Carl Stokes was elected mayor of Cleveland in 1967. In the same year Richard Hatcher was elected mayor of Cary. In Newark, New Jersey, sixty percent of the population were black when Kenneth Gibson was elected in 1970. Thus election of a black mayor in those cities was not very surprising.
In Los Angeles thousands of white citizens voted for Thomas Bradley because they believed he would be a better mayor than the white candidate . Bradley had spent forty-eight of his fifty-five years in Los Angeles. Four years ago Bradley lost mayoral election to Yorty. This time Bradley won.","{

"Your car is a necessary part of your life. You use it every day. Of course, you want to hold on to it so you make sure it has the latest alarm and immobilizer. But despite all these, cars like yours are still stolen every day. In fact, in this country, one car is stolen almost every minute! And if your car is stolen, you only have a 50:50 chance of seeing it again.
Each year, car crime costs nearly PS3 billion. Of course, if you're insured, you won't lose out, or will you? Firstly, you will have to pay extra insurance later on, and then you may not be offered the full amount by the agent. You will probably have to hire a car and you will also lose the value of the contents and accessories   in the car.
Now comes the solution. An RAC Trackstar system, hidden in one of 47 possible secret locations in your car, is the key of our system. If your car is stolen, radio signals are sent at twenty-second intervals from the car to the RAC Trackstar National Control Center via a satellite network. Then a computer gives the vehicle's exact location, speed and direction.
The RAC Trackstar National Control Center, which operates 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, will immediately inform the police in the area where the car is located.

"Since the invention of Guitar Hero and similar computer games, it is no longer necessary to imagine what it would be like to play along with the Beatles--you can come together with them in the virtual world.
Bill Wyman, former bass player  in the Rolling Stones, has pointed out that music video games discourage kids from learning to play real instruments. My own opinion suggest quite opposite.
Last year, I bought Guitar Hero III for our 14-year-old son, Jack. Jack quickly mastered the process and entered an intense period of playing the game.
A few months later, while I was away on tour, a couple of his friends came around with a real electric guitar. Playing Guitar Hero had taught them how to play along the track. Now they wanted to see if they could apply that to the real thing. Jack's friends taught him how to play along to his favorite songs using just his index finger  on the bass string. He got it right away.
Guitar Hero had helped him over the first difficulty for guitar players--how to strum  the strings with one hand while making chord  shapes with the other. He never plays Guitar Hero now, preferring to rock out in the garage with his mates.
Despite my attempts at getting him to learn an instrument, it was Guitar Hero that taught him the basics of playing and built up his confidence to the extent that he was able to make a recognizable sound the first time he played it.
So let's not complain about a game that encourages kids to become music fans and, in our son's case, gives them the basic skills needed to learn how to play guitar.","{

"For the people living in the Nile Basin,the river is their life. This 6,825 km waterway,whose watershed   covers three million square kilometers,flows through mountains,woodlands,lakes and deserts. Its potential for fishing,tourism and shipping is great-but so are its challenges.
Water shortage,already serious in Egypt and Sudan,will soon influence several other countries in the watershed as well. Today,about 160 million people depend on the Nile River for their living. Within the next 25 years,the district's population is expected to double,adding to the demand brought about by growth in industry and agriculture. The frequent drought adds to the urgency.
Water quality is also a problem. Precious soil is washed out to sea. Wastes from industry and agriculture create pollution. Higher concentrations of salt influence irrigated soils. Water-borne diseases remain unchecked. In areas where it's hot and damp, _ grow so fast that they choke off lakes,dams and other sections of the river,making it difficult for fishing and other businesses to move forward.
Native people along the narrow area of farmland have watched the sand move closer day by day. They've seen the river change course,and their only source of water thickened with mud. They're very poor and have few choices.
But a new program,the Nile Basin Initiative(NBI),is offering very practical assistance. The program is more than just a water-management project. It's a plan for the social and economic development of a vast district: it concentrates on the needs of the poorest of the poor and the environment that supports them.
These are whole ecosystem problems,calling for united solutions  .Half the Nile Basin's countries are among the world's poorest nations; yet,somehow,they must find the resources,skills and political will to overcome these challenges.","{

When lunchtime came on his first day there, he went to eat it in the restaurant of the hotel in his new clothes. The headwaiter showed him to the table, took his order and went away. When he returned and looked at the farmer again, he was surprised. The farmer had tied his table cloth round his neck.

"The breaking news of Mo Yan's Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday evening soon aroused public curiosity of the 57-year-old Chinese writer: Why was he favored by the Swedish Academy?
    Less than half an hour after the announcement from Stockholm,  Mo's works turned to ""sold out"" status at China's major online book sellers.
    One lucky buyer wrote in an online comment: ""Rushed to purchase, but to my shame, I have not read any of his novels.""
    Although Mo was entitled one of the top China's literature awards before the Nobel Prize, he is not the most popular novelist in China, in either the book market or in reputation.
    Chinese media seemed to be shocked as some journalists were reported to be on their way overnight to Gaomi City of East China's Shandong Province, Mo's birthplace where he stayed with his family.
    Born in 1955 into a rural family, Mo dropped out of school and became a farmer when he was a teenager. He joined the army and devoted himself to writing. Mo's novels were translated into several languages.
    For more than a century, Nobel Prize has been regarded by the world as recognition to an individual or even a nation's cultural and scientific advances.
    ""I think the reason why I could win the prize is that my works present lives with unique Chinese characteristics, and they also tell stones from a viewpoint of common human beings, which transcends differences of nations and races,"" Mo said on Thursday evening to Chinese journalists.
    Mo also said many folk arts originated from his hometown, such as paper cuts and traditional new year paintings, have inspired and influenced his novels.
    Mo's prize may give powerful encouragement to the country's writers as the more reflective of Chinese lives their works are, the more possible they arise as world literature.","{

"À l'âge de sept ans, mon père m'a offert une Timex, ma première montre. Je l'adorais, je la portais pendant des années et je n'en ai pas eu d'autre depuis qu'elle a cessé de fonctionner il y a dix ans. Pourquoi ? Parce que je n'en ai pas besoin. J'ai un téléphone portable et je suis toujours près de quelqu'un avec un iPod ou quelque chose de similaire. Tout cela indique l'heure - c'est pourquoi, si vous regardez autour de vous, vous verrez beaucoup de poignets vides ; les ventes de montres aux jeunes adultes sont en baisse depuis 2007.

Mais tandis que ces sages personnes ont réalisé qu'elles n'en avaient pas besoin, d'autres - y compris certains des plus distingués de notre époque - dépensent des fortunes entières pour les acheter. Des marques comme Rolex, Patek Philippe et Breitling affichent des prix exorbitants, allant jusqu'à 250 000 £ la pièce.

C'est ridicule. Les voitures chères vont plus vite que les voitures bon marché. Les vêtements chers tombent mieux que les vêtements bon marché. Mais de nos jours, toutes les montres indiquent l'heure aussi bien que toutes les autres montres. Oui, vous pouvez dire que les montres chères auront des fonctions supplémentaires - mais qui en a besoin ? Combien de fois plongez-vous à 300 mètres dans la mer pour tester sa fonction d'étanchéité, ou devez-vous trouver votre direction dans la zone autour du pôle Sud en utilisant sa boussole ? Alors pourquoi payer autant, l'équivalent de cinq années de frais de scolarité, pour des montres qui vous permettent de faire ces choses ?

Si justice était faite, l'industrie horlogère suisse aurait dû fermer ses portes lorsque les Japonais ont découvert comment fabriquer des montres précises pour cinq livres sterling. Au lieu de cela, les Suisses ont réinventé la montre, avec l'aide de millions de livres sterling de publicité, comme un message sur l'homme - généralement une star célèbre - qui la porte. Les Rolex sont pour ceux qui passent leurs week-ends à gravir des montagnes glacées ; une Patek Philippe est pour quelqu'un issu d'une famille riche ou noble ; une Breitling suggère que vous aimez piloter des avions à travers le monde.

Les montres sont désormais classées comme des « objets d'investissement ». Une Philippe de 1994 s'est récemment vendue près de 350 000 £, tandis que les Rolex des années 1960 sont passées de 15 000 à 30 000 £ et plus en un an. Mais, pour certaines personnes fortunées, une montre est plus qu'un investissement. C'est un jouet précieux pour la satisfaction personnelle, une question de mode. Les prix peuvent continuer à grimper - ils augmentent depuis quinze ans. Mais lorsque la mode évoluera, le propriétaire de cet objet précieux de 350 000 £ constatera soudainement que sa fierté et sa joie ne constituent plus un bon investissement, pas plus que ma Timex d'enfance.

"L'un des plus grands guerriers de l'histoire, Gengis Khan, était issu du peuple mongol. Il contrôla de nombreux pays en Asie et en Europe grâce à sa bravoure et son leadership au combat. Cette période fut connue sous le nom de dynastie Yuan aux XIIIe et XIVe siècles.

Un jour, Gengis décida d'aller chasser, et de nombreux guerriers l'accompagnèrent. Gengis avait son faucon préféré sur le poignet. Le faucon était dressé pour voler haut dans les airs afin de repérer du gibier comme des cerfs, des lapins ou des oiseaux sauvages. Lorsque son oiseau se posait au sol, Gengis le suivait et tirait sur le gibier sauvage avec ses flèches. C'était son passe-temps favori.

Ce jour-là, le gibier était difficile à trouver. Vers le soir, Gengis renvoya tous les hommes chez eux et décida de prendre un autre chemin tout seul. Il laissa même son faucon partir, pensant qu'il rentrerait aussi chez lui. Il eut soif et s'arrêta près de quelques rochers où il remarqua que de l'eau s'égouttait. Il prit une tasse dans son sac et la remplit lentement. Lorsqu'il la porta à sa bouche, il fut surpris car son faucon arriva et renversa toute l'eau de sa tasse.

Il trouva cela très inhabituel et remplit à nouveau la tasse. Le faucon se précipita vers le bas et fit tomber la tasse de sa main. Gengis était maintenant assoiffé et en colère. Alors qu'il remplissait la tasse pour la quatrième fois, il tira son épée pour empêcher l'oiseau de l'interrompre. Alors que l'oiseau descendait, Gengis le tua, mais sa tasse tomba profondément dans les rochers lors de la mêlée.

Il décida de grimper sur le rocher de la montagne pour trouver la source de l'eau. Il trouva une mare et remarqua qu'un énorme serpent venimeux était mort dans l'eau. Il réalisa que le faucon lui avait sauvé la vie. Sa colère l'avait poussé à tuer son oiseau préféré. Dans son désespoir, il promit de bien réfléchir à tout avant de se mettre en colère à nouveau.

"Il existe deux facteurs qui déterminent l'intelligence d'un individu. Le premier est le type de cerveau avec lequel il est né. Les cerveaux humains diffèrent considérablement, certains étant plus capables que d'autres. Mais quel que soit le bon cerveau qu'il ait au départ, un individu aura un faible niveau d'intelligence s'il n'a pas l'occasion d'apprendre. Le deuxième facteur est donc ce qui arrive à l'individu, le type d'environnement dans lequel il est élevé. Si un individu est handicapé sur le plan environnemental, il est probable que son cerveau ne se développera pas et qu'il n'atteindra jamais le niveau d'intelligence dont il est capable.

L'importance de l'environnement dans la détermination de l'intelligence d'un individu peut être démontrée par l'histoire de Peter et Mark X, des jumeaux identiques. Étant identiques, les jumeaux avaient des cerveaux identiques à la naissance, et leurs processus de croissance étaient les mêmes. Lorsque les jumeaux avaient trois mois, leurs parents sont morts et ils ont été placés dans des foyers d'accueil distincts. Peter a été élevé par des parents peu intelligents dans une communauté isolée avec de faibles opportunités éducatives. Mark a été élevé dans la maison de parents aisés qui avaient fait des études supérieures. Il a été lu à voix haute pendant son enfance, envoyé dans de bonnes écoles et a eu toutes les occasions d'être stimulé intellectuellement. Cette différence environnementale s'est poursuivie jusqu'à ce que les jumeaux atteignent la fin de leur adolescence, lorsqu'ils ont subi des tests pour mesurer leur intelligence. Le QI de Mark était de 125, soit 25 points de plus que la moyenne et 40 points de plus que son frère jumeau. Si les jumeaux avaient eu des chances égales, ayant des cerveaux identiques, ils auraient obtenu des résultats à peu près identiques.

"Tony Morrison a remporté cette année le prix Nobel de littérature. Tony Morrison a soixante-deux ans. Elle est née à Lorain, Ohio. Elle est la fille d'agriculteurs qui ont déménagé de l'Alabama, un État du Sud, en Ohio. Elle a étudié à l'Université Harvard à Washington, D.C. et à l'Université Cornell à Ithaca, New York.
Son premier succès est venu en 1970 avec le livre intitulé The Bluest Eye. Il raconte l'histoire d'une jeune fille noire dans une société où les cheveux blonds et les yeux bleus sont considérés comme beaux. Son prochain livre s'appelait Sulla. Il raconte l'histoire de deux jeunes filles noires et de la douleur dans leurs vies alors qu'elles grandissent dans une petite ville de l'Ohio. Son livre The Song of Solomon parle d'un homme noir qui essaie d'oublier son passé d'esclave et de commencer une nouvelle vie. Et Tar Baby explore la relation entre un homme noir et une femme noire. Dans l'histoire, l'auteur soutient que les hommes et les femmes noirs ne peuvent pas s'entendre tant qu'ils ne se sont pas unis pour lutter contre la haine raciale.
Miss Morrison a remporté le prix littéraire le plus prestigieux d'Amérique, le prix Pulitzer en 1988 pour son livre Beloved. C'est une histoire puissante d'une esclave qui tue sa petite fille pour qu'elle ne grandisse pas pour être esclave elle aussi. Son dernier livre, Jazz, a été publié l'année dernière. Il raconte les histoires tristes de la vie d'un homme et d'une femme noirs qui ont déménagé d'une petite ville du Sud à New York. Il se déroule dans les années 1920, à une époque où le jazz est devenu populaire en Amérique.
Tony Morrison est professeur de littérature à l'Université de Princeton dans le New Jersey. Elle dit que la chose la plus merveilleuse à propos de la victoire du prix Nobel est qu'il a finalement été décerné à un écrivain afro-américain. Le prix est évalué à plus de 800 000 dollars. Il sera décerné le 10 décembre à Stockholm, en Suède.

"Nous avons tous déjà ressenti une baisse d'énergie après un déjeuner copieux. On ne peut plus se concentrer, notre niveau d'énergie chute et on rêverait d'une couverture chaude pour se blottir sous notre bureau et faire une sieste rapide. Mais vous avez des choses importantes à faire, comme terminer ce projet ou diriger une réunion d'équipe dans moins d'une heure.
Ne vous inquiétez plus ! J'ai quatre aliments qui vous aideront à retrouver votre concentration et à terminer votre journée de travail plus fort que vous ne l'avez commencée. Gardez ces produits à portée de main dans votre bureau et vous ne souffrirez plus jamais de ce coup de barre mental de 14h.

**Thé vert**
Bien que le café soit un remontant important l'après-midi, le thé vert ne doit pas être négligé.
La combinaison unique de l'acide aminé thiamine et de la caféine s'est avérée dans plusieurs études améliorer la créativité, la capacité à effectuer plusieurs tâches à la fois et le temps de réaction. Essayez quelques recettes de thé incroyables pour commencer.

**Amandes**
Les amandes sont un excellent rechargeur d'après-midi qui, selon des recherches de l'Université Purdue, contribueront également à vos efforts de perte de poids. En effet, les amandes fournissent une énergie soutenue : un mélange de graisses, de fibres et de protéines. Ces éléments font des amandes une collation pratique qui vous donne un shot d'énergie régulier en contrôlant votre glycémie. De plus, des recherches montrent que les personnes qui consomment régulièrement des noix ont jusqu'à 50 % moins de risques de faire une crise cardiaque.

**Yaourt grec**
Des recherches de l'Université du Missouri montrent que les protéines aident votre corps à mieux contrôler sa glycémie en stimulant la libération de l'hormone glucagon. Visez une tasse contenant 20 à 23 grammes de protéines pour votre collation.

**Chocolat noir**
Bien qu'il soit souvent considéré comme un aliment mauvais pour la santé, le chocolat noir peut vous aider à combattre l'envie de faire une sieste en milieu de journée. Si le chocolat noir contient de petites quantités de caféine, sa véritable puissance vient de la phényléthylamine. Des recherches de l'Université de Middlesex à Londres montrent que le simple fait de sentir le chocolat peut modifier l'activité cérébrale pour une meilleure attention.

"Alors que je marchais le long d'Edgware Road, j'avais l'impression que le monde se refermait sur moi. Tous les sons que je prends pour acquis avaient disparu. J'étais entré dans un monde de silence. Cette expérience troublante s'est produite il y a quelques semaines, lorsque j'ai accepté de devenir sourd pour la journée afin de soutenir le travail de l'association Hearing Dogs for Deaf People, dont je suis l'ambassadeur.

Lorsque j'ai réussi à prendre un taxi pour me rendre au bureau de mon manager, Gavin, je n'entendais pas ce que le chauffeur de taxi me disait. La conversation était impossible. Puis, arrivé au bureau, j'ai dû sonner l'interphone cinq fois car je n'entendais pas de réponse.

Tout le monde disait que je leur criais dessus - je ne me rendais tout simplement pas compte à quel point je parlais fort car je n'entendais pas ma propre voix. Gavin n'arrêtait pas de me dire que mon téléphone sonnait, mais je ne m'en rendais pas compte. J'étais trop occupé à essayer de me concentrer sur la lecture de ses lèvres. Et quand il a essayé de me donner un code à entrer dans mon téléphone, j'ai dû lui demander de le répéter, plus lentement. Finalement, il a perdu patience et m'a lancé : ""Donne-moi juste le téléphone !"" J'étais choqué.

Les gens ne se sont pas donné la peine de répéter, alors ils ont continué à essayer de faire des choses pour moi que j'étais parfaitement capable de faire moi-même. J'avais l'impression d'avoir perdu le contrôle.

Être sourd pour la journée était extraordinairement fatigant. J'ai dû faire beaucoup d'efforts pour ""écouter"" avec mes yeux, attirer l'attention des gens et utiliser mes autres sens pour compenser mon manque d'ouïe. C'était un effort immense et épuisant.

Avant cette expérience, je ne réalisais pas à quel point je prenais mon audition pour acquise, ni le genre d'émotions et d'expériences que vivent les personnes sourdes. Si une personne sourde vous demande de répéter quelque chose, ne pensez jamais : ""Ce n'est pas grave."" C'est grave.

"Quiconque a remarqué le nombre impressionnant de photos de courses à pied en sueur le dimanche matin sur Internet doit penser que les marathons ont récemment retrouvé leur popularité. Selon Running USA, une organisation qui suit la croissance de ce sport, 52 % des coureurs actuels se suivent à l'aide d'un appareil GPS, comme un smartphone ou un tracker de fitness. Cette statistique a probablement joué un rôle dans l'attrait croissant de la course à pied : les informations de suivi facilement disponibles ont attiré des personnes vers ce sport et les ont maintenues en haleine, car il est possible pour tous de voir en temps réel comment cela affecte leur corps.

Aujourd'hui, des applications gratuites pour smartphone peuvent fournir aux coureurs des informations sur des éléments tels que le nombre et la longueur de leurs pas, leur fréquence cardiaque, voire le volume estimé d'oxygène qu'ils consomment par minute. Toutes ces informations peuvent servir de récompense et de motivation pour le coureur. « C'est une chose d'entendre des encouragements d'un entraîneur », explique Bryan Boyle, rédacteur en chef du magazine Runner's World. « Mais c'en est une autre d'apprécier, d'un seul coup d'œil, les progrès réalisés pendant des semaines et des mois de course. »

Mais la technologie de suivi des courses ne permet pas seulement aux coureurs de s'entraîner plus dur. Elle leur donne également le pouvoir de s'entraîner plus intelligemment. Les coureurs récréatifs d'aujourd'hui n'ont plus à deviner la distance ou la vitesse à laquelle ils ont couru, ou ce que leur corps fait. S'ils peuvent surveiller leur fréquence cardiaque, ils peuvent s'assurer qu'ils maintiennent le rythme le plus stratégique à chaque course, ce qui peut augmenter considérablement leurs chances d'avoir une expérience positive sur le parcours pendant le jour de la course.

Quelle que soit la mesure dans laquelle la technologie peut favoriser l'expérience de la course à pied, de nombreux coureurs affirment que le plus grand avantage de ce sport reste la possibilité de sortir à l'extérieur, loin de l'ordinateur, pendant une heure. « Il y a tellement plus à vivre », ajoute Boyle. « L'air frais, le voyage, le tir, juste le sentiment général d'être mieux. Il n'y a pas d'application pour ça. »

"Ces cinquante dernières années ont vu la disparition progressive des animaux de la terre, des poissons de la mer, des arbres et des plantes de la terre.

De nombreux facteurs contribuent à ce phénomène déplaisant. Parmi eux, la chasse est le principal facteur qui met en danger la faune. Certaines personnes tuent les animaux sauvages pour le sport. Ils prennent plaisir à collectionner les têtes et les peaux. D'autres se spécialisent dans la chasse commerciale, comme la chasse à la baleine.

Outre cela, la croissance rapide de la population humaine menace également la faune terrestre. Les villes s'étendent et des routes doivent être construites, les forêts sont donc brûlées et les arbres abattus. Il semble que l'homme ait besoin de chaque pouce de terre à sa portée, il s'attaque donc à l'habitat naturel de la faune. Tigres, lions et léopards meurent lentement sans la nourriture et l'abri que les forêts leur fournissent.

De plus, l'urbanisation rapide signifie une expansion industrielle. Très souvent, des produits chimiques toxiques, des déchets industriels et du pétrole sont déversés dans les rivières et les mers. Les poissons et les oiseaux sont menacés.

L'homme dépend fortement des animaux pour sa survie. Il a besoin de leur chair, de leurs peaux et de leurs fourrures. Ainsi, l'homme ne peut pas vivre sans la faune ; ou il mourrait lui-même. Le public doit être sensibilisé au fait qu'il serait préférable de tirer sur les animaux avec un appareil photo plutôt qu'avec une arme à feu. De cette façon, ils peuvent préserver et aider la faune à continuer de vivre plutôt que de supprimer toutes les traces de celle-ci.

L'homme doit apprendre à cultiver la mer comme il le fait pour la terre. Il devrait contrôler la quantité et la fréquence de ses prises. L'homme a également besoin de construire des réserves et d'adopter des lois pour mettre fin au massacre des animaux, en particulier ceux qui sont déjà rares. Pour préserver le règne animal actuel, le minimum que l'homme puisse faire est de nettoyer les mers et de prévenir la pollution.

"  **Mémo à :** Parents 
**De :** Bureau de l'administration, École élémentaire St. Augustine 
**Sujet :** Programme de déjeuner et informations scolaires 
**Date :** Mardi 23 novembre 2010

Nous tenons à remercier tous les parents et tuteurs pour leur collaboration dans la mise en œuvre de notre nouvelle méthode de livraison du programme de déjeuner. Jusqu'à présent, le test d'un mois du nouveau système s'est déroulé en douceur.

Pour votre commodité, nous avons inclus une copie de l'enveloppe ci-dessous afin que vous puissiez enregistrer les jours où vous avez commandé le déjeuner pour votre enfant. Vous pouvez garder cette copie à la maison pour référence.

Veuillez noter que les déjeuners sont préparés en utilisant les lignes directrices de l'alimentation scolaire, tant en termes d'articles servis que de taille. Au cours des deux premières semaines, certaines personnes ont ajouté des éléments au menu, comme la commande d'articles supplémentaires. En raison de la logistique impliquée et de notre base limitée de bénévoles, nous ne pouvons pas répondre à ces demandes.

**Processus de commande :**

Cette année, nous distribuerons une enveloppe de déjeuner de deux semaines. Si vous décidez de commander le repas offert un jour donné, cochez simplement la case devant ce choix de repas. Par exemple, si vous choisissez sept repas sur les deux semaines, veuillez joindre (7 x 2,00 $) quatorze dollars (14,00 $) dans l'enveloppe. Scellez-la et retournez-la au professeur de votre enfant. Veuillez noter que le coût du déjeuner reste le même : 2,00 $ par jour et comprend les fruits et le lait.

Vous remarquerez que nous avons également réduit les choix quotidiens. Par exemple, le vendredi, nous offrions des hamburgers au poulet et des hamburgers. Cela a été changé en hamburgers au poulet une semaine et en hamburgers la semaine suivante. Les aliments préparés selon des demandes spéciales ont également été modifiés. Ces articles seront désormais préparés avec les mêmes ingrédients.

Si votre enfant n'aime pas le déjeuner servi un jour donné, veuillez vous assurer qu'il a un lunch emballé de la maison.

Merci de votre attention sur ce sujet et nous nous réjouissons de collaborer avec vous encore une fois cette année.

Veuillez retourner les enveloppes jointes au plus tard le jeudi 2 décembre 2011.

"Le tulou, l'architecture résidentielle particulière de la province du Fujian, a été inscrit sur la liste du patrimoine mondial de l'UNESCO lors de la 32e session du Comité du patrimoine mondial à Québec, au Canada.

Au IVe siècle, les Han chinois vivant dans la région de la plaine centrale ont commencé à migrer vers le sud, se rassemblant progressivement dans le Fujian et formant les communautés Hakka. Pour se défendre contre les ennemis, les Hakka ont choisi de vivre dans des communautés compactes, et le tulou était leur maison préférée. Des dizaines de milliers de ces structures de terre ont été construites dans la province du Fujian.

La plupart des tulous se trouvent dans les vallées, entourées de hautes montagnes, et certains se trouvent au plus profond des grandes montagnes. La plupart mesurent trois à quatre étages de haut et ressemblent à des blockhaus circulaires. Les pièces au premier étage servent de cuisines, les pièces au deuxième étage servent de granges, et les pièces au troisième et au quatrième étage servent de chambres à coucher et de salons. Pour des raisons défensives, les pièces au premier étage n'ont pas de fenêtres.

Les matières premières pour le tulou étaient obtenues localement. Leur principal matériau de construction était un mélange d'argile, de sable, de chaux et d'eau, et des blancs d'œufs, du sucre brun et de l'eau de riz étaient ajoutés comme agents adhésifs. Le tout était ensuite mélangé pour former les murs. Une fois secs, les murs étaient si durs qu'il aurait été difficile d'y enfoncer un clou. Des branches de sapin, extrêmement solides et imputrescibles, étaient utilisées pour les renforcer, et de nombreux siècles plus tard, elles ont conservé leur aspect original.

Les tulous sont situés dans une région où les tremblements de terre sont fréquents, et leur construction circulaire les aide à résister aux secousses régulières.

La conception éprouvée a même inspiré un célèbre architecte péruvien, qui a effectué plusieurs visites à Yongding, pour construire un tulou dans son pays d'origine. Peu de temps après, un tremblement de terre a frappé à seulement 10 kilomètres de là, et tandis que toutes les maisons autour du bâtiment en terre se sont effondrées, son tulou est resté debout.

"Ce week-end, une amie très proche m'a appelée et m'a posé une question précise sur la façon de gagner quelques dollars supplémentaires chaque mois en ligne. Pour protéger son identité et les détails, je l'appellerai Annie dans cet article. Vous voyez, Annie souffre d'une forme grave de syndrome d'inaction ; elle est pleine de bonnes idées qui ne se concrétisent jamais en argent et elle a du mal à trouver le lien qui permettra d'y parvenir.

Quelqu'un a un jour dit que la connaissance est le pouvoir, mais nous constatons constamment auprès des lecteurs de notre site Web qu'ils ont une connaissance brûlante et n'ont toujours pas de pouvoir. Regardez les universitaires dans les universités du monde entier ; ils ont tellement de connaissances qu'ils devraient contrôler la richesse du monde. En réalité, ils travaillent pour des cacahuètes et très peu d'entre eux atteignent jamais le pouvoir de l'indépendance. La connaissance n'est donc certainement pas le pouvoir. Par conséquent, nous devrions changer cette déclaration ""sage"" en : ""Le pouvoir est la capacité d'utiliser la connaissance à son propre avantage.""

Ce paragraphe a été inséré parce qu'Annie est une universitaire typique - forte en paroles et en plans, mais un peu plus faible en actions. Au cours d'une conversation de vingt minutes, elle a exposé toute une liste de plans et d'idées pour gagner les quelques centaines de dollars supplémentaires par mois qu'elle recherchait. Chacune de ses nombreuses idées était une source de revenus potentielle, mais elle n'avait pris aucune mesure pour les réaliser. À un moment donné, elle a dit : ""Je ne sais pas quoi faire ensuite.""

C'était mon signal pour m'impliquer. ""Agissez"", ai-je conseillé.

Tout ce qui est faux, c'est qu'Annie était inactive sans le savoir. En cinq minutes, nous avons élaboré un plan d'action et convenu de nous reparler dans un mois pour faire le point sur les progrès. Lorsque nous avons terminé la conversation, elle semblait beaucoup plus heureuse et motivée qu'au début. Annie a juste besoin d'un petit **coup de pouce** pour passer à l'action bénéfique.

"  C'était une journée chaude et humide, et mon frère Walt et moi avions décidé que la seule façon de la survivre serait d'aller nager dans un trou de baignade profond qui se trouvait de l'autre côté du pâturage de M. Blickez et à travers les bois.
Le seul problème avec notre plan était que ce pâturage était gardé par un énorme taureau Hereford méchant. M. Blickez nous avait dit qu'Elsie était le taureau le plus méchant du canton, peut-être même du comté, et nous le croyions. Mais plus il faisait chaud, plus nous pensions qu'il y avait quelque chose de louche dans son affirmation. D'une part, nous nous souvenions que M. Blickez aimait raconter des histoires à dormir debout ; d'autre part, Elsie semblait être un nom bizarre pour un taureau.
Finalement, j'ai convaincu ma mère de demander la permission de traverser le pâturage, mais un autre problème s'est posé. Ma mère a dit qu'elle parlerait à M. Blickez si nous emmenions notre cousine Joanie avec nous. Joanie était presque deux ans plus âgée que moi et une tête plus grande. Si ses railleries se répandaient dans mon école primaire, ce serait la fin pour moi. En fait, j'avais encore mal à la tête d'une dispute avec elle ce matin-là. ""Je ne vais pas nager avec cette idiote de cousine"", ai-je dit à ma mère.
""Soit Joanie vient avec, soit tu restes à la maison tout seul"", a dit ma mère sur un ton sérieux. J'ai cédé et nous sommes partis. En traversant le pâturage, Walt a crié soudainement. Elsie s'était approchée de lui silencieusement et lui léchait le dos. Joanie et moi nous sommes jetés sous la clôture de fil de fer, mais alors que j'étais au sol, j'ai levé les yeux et j'ai vu qu'Elsie n'était pas un gros taureau méchant après tout. Elle allait continuer à lécher le dos de mon frère aussi longtemps qu'il restait immobile.
Nous avons passé de nombreuses bonnes journées en grandissant et en visitant notre trou de baignade secret gardé par le soi-disant ""gros taureau méchant"". Et il s'est avéré que, pour une cousine, Joanie n'a pas été si mauvaise. Elle a été l'une de mes meilleures amies au fil des ans.

"Les personnes qui réussissent ne blâment jamais quelqu'un ou quelque chose d'extérieur à elles-mêmes pour leur incapacité à aller de l'avant. Elles réalisent que leur avenir est entre leurs mains. Elles comprennent qu'elles ne peuvent pas contrôler certaines choses dans la vie, comme la nature, le passé et les autres. Mais en même temps, elles sont conscientes qu'elles peuvent contrôler leurs propres pensées et actions. Elles assument la responsabilité de leur vie et considèrent cela comme l'une des choses les plus stimulantes qu'elles puissent faire. 

Peut-être ce qui différencie le plus les personnes qui réussissent des autres, c'est qu'elles vivent leur vie ""avec un but"" – elles font ce qu'elles croient être leur raison d'être. Selon elles, avoir un but dans la vie est le facteur le plus important qui leur permet de devenir des personnes pleinement fonctionnelles. Elles affirment que lorsqu'elles vivent leur vie avec un but, leur principale préoccupation est de bien faire leur travail. Elles aiment ce qu'elles font – et cela se voit, les gens veulent faire affaire avec elles en raison de leur dévouement à leur travail.

Pour vivre leur vie avec un but, les personnes qui réussissent trouvent une cause en laquelle elles croient et créent une entreprise autour de celle-ci. De plus, elles n'abandonnent jamais facilement. Une fois qu'elles se sont fixé des objectifs dans leur vie, elles sont prêtes à faire tout ce qu'il faut pour les atteindre. Les personnes qui réussissent le mieux n'oublient jamais qu'elles n'ont pas le temps de perdre. Au lieu de voir cela comme quelque chose de négatif ou de déprimant, elles utilisent cette connaissance pour s'encourager à aller de l'avant et à poursuivre ce qu'elles veulent avec énergie et passion.

"Dans leurs derniers instants avant le décollage du vol, j'ai entendu un père dire à sa fille : ""Je t'aime, je te souhaite assez."" La fille répondit : ""Papa, notre vie ensemble a été plus qu'assez. Ton amour est tout ce dont j'ai jamais eu besoin. Je te souhaite assez à moi aussi."" Ils se sont embrassés au revoir et la fille est partie. J'ai pu voir que le père était très triste.

Soudain, le père s'est dirigé vers moi et m'a demandé : ""As-tu déjà dit au revoir à quelqu'un en sachant que ce serait la dernière fois ?""

Ses paroles m'ont fait penser à mon père. Réalisant que les jours de mon père étaient limités, j'ai pris le temps de lui dire en face à quel point il comptait pour moi. J'ai donc compris ce que ce père ressentait.

""Oui, je l'ai fait"", ai-je répondu. ""Mais pourquoi est-ce un dernier au revoir ?""

""Je suis vieux et ma fille habite trop loin. Peut-être que son prochain voyage de retour sera pour mes funérailles"", a-t-il dit.

""Quand tu disais au revoir, j'ai entendu dire 'Je te souhaite assez'. Qu'est-ce que cela signifie ?""

Il a commencé à sourire. ""Mes parents me le disaient. Quand on dit 'Je te souhaite assez', on veut que l'autre personne ait une vie remplie de suffisamment de bonnes choses."" Il s'est arrêté un moment et a continué : ""Je te souhaite assez de soleil pour que ton attitude reste lumineuse. Je te souhaite assez de pluie pour apprécier davantage le soleil.

"C'est le moment de partir en voyage de printemps. Savez-vous comment les enfants de différents pays passent leurs vacances ?

**Les enfants en Chine**

Lorsque le printemps arrive, les enfants veulent être dehors, alors certaines écoles organisent généralement un voyage de printemps pour eux. Cela pourrait être un voyage à la montagne. Là, les enfants peuvent grimper, faire voler des cerfs-volants, profiter des fleurs, etc. Parfois, leurs professeurs les emmènent au Parc des Martyrs. Les élèves peuvent déposer des fleurs sur les tombes.

**Les enfants au Japon**

En avril, tandis que les Chinois profitent des jasmins d'hiver, les Japonais profitent des cerisiers en fleurs. C'est la meilleure période de l'année pour les enfants pour faire un voyage. Ils prennent des paniers-repas, chantent et dansent sous les arbres.

**Les enfants au Royaume-Uni**

Ils ont beaucoup de choix quand il s'agit de voyage scolaire. Ils peuvent visiter la côte ou un parc d'attractions. L'un des endroits les plus spéciaux à visiter est le centre ornithologique. Ces enfants peuvent voir des canards et d'autres oiseaux. Les personnes du centre sont des scientifiques. Cela signifie qu'ils peuvent enseigner aux enfants l'habitat des oiseaux. Les enfants passent du temps dans un endroit magnifique et apprennent également quelque chose sur le monde naturel sans avoir besoin de manuels scolaires.

"Lors de leurs migrations, les papillons et les papillons de nuit choisissent les vents avec lesquels ils veulent voler et modifient leur position corporelle s'ils commencent à dériver dans la mauvaise direction. Cette nouvelle découverte suggère que les insectes pourraient utiliser certaines des mêmes méthodes que les oiseaux pour parcourir de longues distances. Les scientifiques pensaient depuis longtemps que les insectes étaient simplement à la merci du vent.

Aussi fascinants que soient leurs talents de vol, le comportement migratoire a été difficile à étudier chez les insectes car de nombreux voyages sur de longues distances se produisent à des milliers de pieds au-dessus du sol. Ce n'est que récemment que les scientifiques ont développé des technologies capables de détecter de si petites créatures à de telles altitudes.

À leur grande surprise, les insectes n'étaient pas des voyageurs passifs sur les vents. En automne, par exemple, la plupart des vents légers soufflaient de l'est, mais les insectes ont en quelque sorte recherché ceux qui les emmenaient vers le sud et se sont positionnés pour naviguer directement vers leurs quartiers d'hiver.

Même au printemps, lorsque la plupart des vents soufflaient vers le nord, les insectes ne suivaient pas toujours le courant. Si la brise ne soufflait pas exactement dans la direction où ils voulaient aller, les insectes modifiaient leur position corporelle pour compenser. De nombreux oiseaux migrateurs font de même.

L'étude a également révélé que les papillons et les papillons de nuit volaient activement dans les courants d'air qui les poussaient. En additionnant les vitesses de vol aux vitesses du vent, les scientifiques ont calculé que les papillons et les papillons de nuit peuvent voyager jusqu'à 100 kilomètres à l'heure. Les conclusions pourraient avoir des applications concrètes. Avec le réchauffement climatique, les insectes migrateurs sont de plus en plus nombreux. Savoir comment et quand ces ravageurs se déplacent pourrait aider les agriculteurs à décider quand pulvériser leurs cultures.

"La plupart des jeunes garçons n'aiment pas cultiver des fleurs et les arroser. Mais pour Angus, 16 ans, travailler au jardin n'est pas qu'un passe-temps - cela a changé sa vie.
Angus souffre d'une maladie particulière et son QI est inférieur à celui d'un garçon normal. Il y a six mois, il a commencé à apprendre à cultiver des fleurs. Maintenant, il passe des heures au jardin à faire pousser des fleurs, à les arroser et à en prendre soin. ""Avant de travailler au jardin, il était difficile pour Angus de se concentrer en classe et parfois il ne voulait pas aller à l'école"", a déclaré sa mère, Kim. ""Maintenant, il a hâte d'aller à l'école et il est heureux tous les jours. Nous pouvons voir qu'Angus est capable de travailler dans un centre de jardinage à l'avenir.""
Des recherches montrent que travailler au jardin améliore la santé mentale et physique. Par le passé, les soldats en Égypte traitaient leurs problèmes mentaux après la guerre en travaillant au jardin. Même maintenant, certains médecins conseillent aux gens de travailler au jardin pour traiter leurs problèmes de santé mentale. Et les médecins conseillent également aux jeunes comme Angus de travailler au jardin.
La vie de centaines d'enfants en Grande-Bretagne ayant des besoins spéciaux, comme Angus, a été transformée par ce type d'éducation particulier. En travaillant au jardin, les enfants ont l'occasion d'apprendre de nombreuses compétences importantes, comme la façon de travailler avec les autres et la façon de prendre soin des plantes. De plus, les enfants deviennent plus confiants après avoir travaillé au jardin.

"Nous savons tous que de bonnes habitudes d'étude sont essentielles pour réussir. Nous pouvons probablement réduire la malhonnêteté académique en encourageant de bonnes habitudes d'étude chez les étudiants. En faisant savoir aux élèves à quel point de bonnes habitudes d'étude sont importantes lorsqu'ils arrivent à l'école. Pourtant, même la procrastination peut être surmontée par de bonnes habitudes d'étude, et l'amélioration de ces habitudes est la clé d'une meilleure étude.

Les bonnes habitudes d'étude sont un excellent outil à avoir dans la boîte à outils de la vie. Bon nombre des conseils pour réussir pour les étudiants en ligne sont les mêmes que ceux pour les étudiants en classe. Envisagez de demander à l'union étudiante de l'école d'entreprendre un projet de conseils d'étude. Suivre quelques conseils d'étude simples peut aider les étudiants à apprendre efficacement de nouveaux concepts et théories.

Une bonne façon de rester organisé est d'utiliser des dossiers afin que votre enfant puisse garder ses devoirs. Une fois que les enfants atteignent les niveaux où les devoirs et les tests font partie du programme d'études, les parents peuvent faire beaucoup de choses pour encourager de bonnes habitudes d'étude. Une façon efficace est d'étudier avant et pendant qu'ils font leurs devoirs. Être organisé et avoir des routines de devoirs sont les choses les plus importantes pour aider votre enfant à développer de bonnes habitudes pour la vie.

L'apprentissage, cependant, est un processus qui se décompose en certaines étapes. Les élèves ayant des problèmes d'apprentissage, cependant, peuvent toujours avoir des habitudes et des compétences d'étude généralement inefficaces et inefficaces.

Devenir conscient du style d'apprentissage de votre enfant vous aidera à comprendre pourquoi il est parfois frustré par les méthodes d'étude courantes.

Des habitudes d'étude efficaces sont une partie très importante du processus d'apprentissage. Les bonnes habitudes d'étude consistent à respecter une routine quotidienne et à traiter tous les sujets de manière égale. Si les habitudes d'étude de votre enfant sont faibles, suivez un cours de « compétences d'étude » ou demandez à quelqu'un de lui montrer de bonnes habitudes d'étude.

Le problème est que ces habitudes d'étude du lycée sont difficiles à oublier. Le travail acharné et les bonnes habitudes d'étude sont deux caractères à cultiver. La motivation et les habitudes d'étude sont évidemment très importantes également.

"Les ordinateurs sont utilisés dans l'enseignement depuis plus de vingt ans. Mais un nouveau livre affirme que ce n'est que maintenant qu'ils changent l'éducation. Et il prédit qu'il va se passer beaucoup de choses.

Le livre s'intitule ""Disrupting Class : How Disruptive Innovation Will Change the Way the World Learns"". ""L'innovation disruptive"" est une théorie développée par l'auteur principal Clayton Christensen, professeur à la Harvard Business School. Il affirme que les organisations utilisent presque toujours les nouvelles technologies créatives uniquement pour poursuivre ce qu'elles font déjà.

Les nouvelles technologies devraient changer les organisations, dit-il, et les perturber de manière positive. Elles devraient utiliser la technologie pour faire les choses différemment - par exemple, pour répondre à davantage de besoins. Le livre affirme que la force disruptive nécessaire dans l'éducation est l'apprentissage assisté par ordinateur.

Michael Horn, un autre auteur de ""Disrupting Class"", nous a parlé d'un établissement scolaire public de Boston qu'il a visité. Chaque élève du Lilla G. Frederick Middle School de Dorchester, dans le Massachusetts, dispose d'un ordinateur portable. Une classe apprenait les tempêtes. Michael Horn affirme que les ordinateurs portables ont permis de véritablement individualiser les leçons, de diviser les matières en fonction du niveau et du style d'apprentissage. À la fin du cours, tous les élèves ont participé à une discussion animée par l'enseignant.

L'apprentissage assisté par ordinateur offre aux élèves la possibilité de suivre des cours avancés non proposés dans leur école ou de reprendre des cours qu'ils ont échoués. Il sert également ceux qui ne peuvent pas se rendre physiquement à l'école, ainsi que les élèves qui sont scolarisés à domicile.

L'apprentissage assisté par ordinateur comprend les cours en ligne. Les inscriptions aux cours en ligne ont augmenté de façon spectaculaire. En 2007, les États-Unis comptaient environ un million d'inscriptions, hors cours universitaires. Les élèves pouvaient être inscrits à plus d'un cours, par le biais des écoles ou des entreprises d'éducation. Les élèves du secondaire représentent environ 70 % des inscriptions. Pourtant, à l'échelle nationale, seulement environ 1 % de tous les cours du secondaire l'année dernière étaient dispensés en ligne.

Mais les auteurs de ""Disrupting Class"" prédisent que ce chiffre atteindra 10 % dans environ six ans. Et leurs recherches suggèrent que ce chiffre sera d'environ 50 % en 2019. Et Michael Horn affirme que l'avenir de l'apprentissage en ligne pourrait être encore plus important dans les pays en développement.

"Pendant des siècles, l'humanité et les chiens ont souffert d'un manque de communication. Nous pouvons dire aux chiens ce que nous voulons qu'ils fassent et parfois ils obéissent, mais nous avons toujours eu du mal à comprendre la vraie signification de leurs aboiements et de leurs gémissements. Il y a maintenant une nouvelle excitante - un traducteur pour chien a été inventé pour vous aider à communiquer avec votre ami à fourrure.

Des chercheurs de l'Université d'État de Caroline du Nord ont conçu une sorte de harnais miracle pour traducteur de chien. Ce qui est spécial, c'est qu'il ne se contente pas de s'appuyer sur les vocalises du chien pour interpréter ce que Fido raconte.

Oh non, ce harnais miracle lit et interprète également le langage corporel ordinaire des chiens, nous offrant une expérience de communication bidirectionnelle complète avec les chiens.

Le chercheur David Roberts déclare : « Les chiens communiquent principalement par le langage corporel, et l'un de nos défis était de développer des capteurs qui nous renseignent sur leur comportement en observant leur posture à distance. »

Des capteurs sur le harnais surveillent le rythme cardiaque et la température corporelle du chien, et un logiciel construit un vocabulaire, permettant à l'humain de savoir ce que le chien ressent.

Que diraient les chiens s'ils pouvaient nous parler ? L'humain peut même communiquer en retour via le harnais grâce à des moteurs de vibration, supposément en s'appuyant sur les sens du chien afin qu'il puisse comprendre ce que vous essayez de lui dire.

Le harnais pour chien est conçu pour les chiens impliqués dans les recherches et les sauvetages et autres travaux de première ligne, mais il nous fait rêver d'un bel avenir, où les humains et les chiens peuvent coexister en tant qu'égaux, le chien étant capable de s'exprimer pleinement en tout temps.

"À quelle fréquence changez-vous de coiffure ou demandez-vous de nouvelles robes ? Vous essayez peut-être de suivre les tendances des pays occidentaux, mais vos pairs aux États-Unis ne se soucient pas autant de la mode que vous.
Une récente enquête menée auprès de lycéens en Chine, au Japon, en Corée du Sud et aux États-Unis a révélé que les adolescents asiatiques se soucient davantage de leur apparence que les jeunes aux États-Unis.

"Même les cerveaux d'oiseaux peuvent apprendre à connaître un continent entier - mais cela leur prend un an de migration pour le faire, suggère une équipe de recherche de Princeton.

Les scientifiques ont démontré que les moineaux adultes migrateurs peuvent trouver leur chemin vers leurs lieux de nidification hivernale même après avoir été déroutés de milliers de kilomètres.

L'équipe a d'abord amené 30 moineaux à Princeton depuis le nord de l'État de Washington, où les oiseaux étaient en train de migrer vers le sud depuis leurs lieux de reproduction estivaux en Alaska. La moitié des oiseaux étaient des juvéniles d'environ trois mois qui n'avaient jamais migré auparavant, tandis que l'autre moitié étaient des adultes qui avaient fait l'aller-retour vers leur site d'hivernage dans le sud-ouest des États-Unis au moins une fois.

Après la libération des oiseaux, ils ont tenté de reprendre leur migration, mais les deux groupes d'âge se sont rapidement désorientés.

""Tous les oiseaux se sont dispersés au début"", a déclaré Wikelski. ""Il était clair qu'ils étaient désorientés pendant quelques jours. Mais tandis que les adultes ont finalement réalisé qu'ils devaient se diriger vers le sud-ouest, les oiseaux plus jeunes ont repris leur vol droit vers le sud comme s'ils étaient toujours dans l'État de Washington.""

""Les adultes"", a déclaré Richard Holland, membre de l'équipe, ""ont retrouvé leur cap parce qu'ils possèdent quelque chose que les oiseaux plus jeunes n'ont pas, à savoir une carte interne.""

""Ces oiseaux ont besoin de deux choses pour savoir où ils sont et migrer efficacement : une 'carte' et une 'boussole'"", a déclaré Holland, chercheur postdoctoral dans le laboratoire de Wikelski. ""Ce que nous avons découvert, c'est que les juvéniles utilisent leur boussole, mais les adultes utilisent également leur carte.""

Holland a déclaré : ""Les oiseaux ne perdent pas la boussole en vieillissant, mais développent en quelque sorte la carte, appliquant finalement les deux outils pour rester sur la bonne voie pendant les vols migratoires. Les scientifiques ont déjà déterminé que la boussole est basée sur le soleil ou le champ magnétique, mais l'origine de la carte reste un mystère - un mystère que l'équipe explorera dans les années à venir.""

"Les tests ne sont pas amusants, mais ils sont nécessaires. Mais dans des endroits comme le Colorado, le Connecticut et New York, nous assistons à un nouveau mouvement problématique au sein de l'éducation publique visant à convaincre les parents de retirer leurs enfants de toute participation aux tests standardisés. Ils optent pour le refus des examens conçus pour mesurer dans quelle mesure nos écoles enseignent à nos enfants. 

Examinons pourquoi certains parents optent pour le refus. L'argument le plus courant est que les tests standardisés prennent trop de temps de classe à l'enseignement. Oui, dans trop d'écoles et dans trop de districts, il y a une sur-insistance sur les tests. En tant que parent, je comprends ce problème. Ma fille est rentrée de l'école publique un jour et a dit que le cours était facile maintenant que « le test » était terminé. Et j'ai pensé : « Que communiquons-nous à nos enfants s'ils pensent que le test est la chose la plus importante - et une fois qu'il est terminé, l'apprentissage se termine ? » 

Ces districts obsédés par les tests doivent changer. Mais une nouvelle étude de Teach Plus, une organisation qui défend les élèves des écoles urbaines, a révélé qu'en moyenne, en troisième et en septième année, seulement 1,7 % du temps de classe est consacré à la préparation et à la passation de tests standardisés. Ce n'est pas du tout choquant. La plupart des gens passent un pourcentage plus important de leur temps éveillé à choisir une tenue à porter ou à regarder la télévision. 

Nous ne devrions pas non plus accepter le faux argument selon lequel les tests restreignent trop les éducateurs, l'innovation en classe ou enlèvent le plaisir d'enseigner. Cette façon de penser suppose que le test est le fin mot de l'histoire - et si tel est le point de vue, le plaisir est déjà disparu depuis longtemps. Les enseignants entrent dans cette profession parce qu'ils se soucient des enfants, croient que chacun a la capacité de réussir et veulent enseigner bien au-delà de la compétence minimale. Les enseignants les plus précieux sont ceux qui transmettent des connaissances, pas seulement des informations, et le font d'une manière qui engage les élèves et rend l'école intéressante.

« D'accord », répond la foule qui refuse de participer, « que dire des enfants qui sont stressés et souffrent d'anxiété à cause des tests standardisés ? » Vous savez quoi ? La vie peut être stressante ; elle peut être difficile. L'alternative est de remettre des prix simplement pour la participation, de donner des A pour éviter de nuire à l'ego d'un enfant - et de continuer à prendre du retard en tant que pays. Je rejette cet état d'esprit. 

Plutôt que d'encourager les parents à refuser de participer aux tests, il serait beaucoup plus productif pour les leaders de ce mouvement distrayant d'aider à améliorer les évaluations. Faire en sorte que les examens reflètent davantage l'apprentissage des élèves. En fin de compte, les élèves et les éducateurs ont besoin de données de test - le refus de participer nuit aux deux. Et cela risque de mettre en danger les progrès dont tous nos enfants ont besoin.

"Lee Ann Laraway est atteinte de poliomyélite et n'est pas capable de beaucoup bouger. La plupart des choses sont hors de sa portée. Jeannie, une labrador retriever, agit comme ses bras et ses jambes. Jeannie comprend 72 commandes ou plus. Lors d'une sortie shopping, elle peut obtenir de l'argent pour Lee Ann à la banque ou des bonbons au magasin. Elle peut payer le caissier et récupérer la monnaie. Jeannie apporte des choses à Lee Ann et les place sur ses genoux.

Jeannie a été dressée dans un endroit appelé Canine Companions for Independence, situé sur un terrain de douze acres à Santa Rosa (Californie). Le terrain a été donné par le dessinateur Charles Shultz. ""Nous dressons ici quatre types de chiens différents"", a déclaré Ken Kirsh, un dresseur de chiens. ""Chiens d'assistance auditive, chiens d'assistance, chiens de compagnie qualifiés et chiens de service.""

Les dresseurs travaillent avec des labradors et des golden retrievers pendant des heures chaque jour, mais tous les chiens ne sont pas assez bons pour être des chiens de travail.

Le travail est une affaire sérieuse. Les chiens d'assistance auditive avertissent leurs propriétaires de sons tels que les sonneries de téléphone et les sonnettes. D'autres chiens travaillent avec des patients handicapés comme Noah Habib, âgé de huit ans, qui communique avec un ordinateur spécial. Il aime quand les gens viennent lui poser des questions sur son chien. Son père dit : ""Les gens sont vraiment intéressés par le chien et viennent lui faire des câlins, jouer avec lui et lui demander ce qu'il fait, et ce sont des personnes qui ne nous aborderaient normalement pas et ne voudraient pas parler à Noah.""

"En Grande-Bretagne, les gens parlent souvent de leurs maisons : de leurs prêts hypothécaires, des taux d'intérêt et de la hausse des prix. Voici un guide de certains mots et expressions que vous pourriez rencontrer.

Il est conseillé au Royaume-Uni de négocier un prêt hypothécaire avec une banque avant de commencer vos recherches. C'est à ce moment-là que la banque vous indique le montant qu'elle est prête à vous prêter, ce qui vous permet d'avoir une idée précise de votre budget.

L'étape suivante consiste à se rendre chez un agent immobilier et de voir quel type de propriétés ils ont disponibles dans votre fourchette de prix et dans votre région. Si vous voyez quelque chose qui vous plaît, l'agent immobilier vous organisera une visite de la propriété afin que vous puissiez voir la maison ou l'appartement par vous-même.

Si vous voyez quelque chose qui vous attire, vous faites une offre. Le vendeur peut accepter ou refuser cette offre, et si le vendeur l'accepte, vous pouvez poursuivre la vente. Cependant, comme vous ne payez aucun argent à ce stade, l'offre n'est pas juridiquement contraignante et, en théorie, vous pouvez vous retirer de l'offre à tout moment.

Votre prochaine étape sera probablement d'obtenir un rapport d'expertise structurelle. Un expert qualifié inspectera la maison et rédigera un rapport qui illustrera tout problème structurel, comme l'humidité ou les problèmes de drainage.

Si vous souhaitez toujours poursuivre la vente, vous devez désigner un avocat pour s'occuper des formalités juridiques. Si vous possédez déjà une maison, vous pourriez également être occupé à essayer de la vendre. De nombreux propriétaires préfèrent vendre à des primo-accédants (ceux qui ne possèdent pas encore de maison), car ils ne sont pas dans une chaîne (en attente que d'autres personnes achètent une maison avant de pouvoir acheter leur prochaine maison).

Enfin, une fois les contrats signés et échangés, vous finalisez l'achat de votre maison. Vous recevez les clés et vous pouvez emménager quand vous le souhaitez. Vous pouvez ensuite organiser une pendaison de crémaillère. Félicitations !

"LOS ANGELES - Jésus Ibarra était perplexe devant le vieil homme.
Il était évidemment beaucoup plus âgé que les autres étudiants du lycée CentralAult. Et c'était un Anglo-Saxon dans un campus où la plupart des étudiants sont des Latinos, des Noirs et des Asiatiques-Américains.
""Je me suis demandé ce qu'il faisait ici"", a déclaré Ibarra, 21 ans, de Los Angeles. ""Je pensais qu'il était un visiteur. La première fois que j'ai parlé à lui, j'ai posé une question en anglais, et il a répondu en espagnol. J'ai pensé qu'il était blanc et juif. Je n'aurais jamais imaginé qu'il parlerait espagnol.""

Blitzstein est chaleureux et sociable (il aime être avec les autres). Il aime entendre une bonne blague et adore raconter une bonne histoire. Il est déterminé, surtout lorsqu'il s'agit de réaliser son rêve.
Récemment, ce rêve s'est réalisé. Lors d'une cérémonie de remise des diplômes à laquelle ont assisté deux de ses enfants et trois de ses petits-enfants, Blitzstein, 81 ans, a obtenu son diplôme d'études secondaires.
Après que le proviseur Lanny Nelms lui ait remis le diplôme et annoncé son âge, Blitzstein a fait signe à l'assistance et a pleuré.
Et pourquoi pas ? Il est probablement le plus vieux diplômé de CentralHigh School depuis l'ouverture de l'école en 1974. Selon le porte-parole du district de Los Angeles, bien qu'aucune trace de ce genre ne soit conservée, Blitzstein est le plus vieux diplômé qu'il ait jamais entendu parler.
Obtenir son diplôme lui a pris 10 ans, au cours desquels le propriétaire de magasin à la retraite a subi une crise cardiaque et des problèmes de santé, et a perdu sa femme et deux frères.

"La Virginie s'apprête à mettre en œuvre la sanction la plus sévère en matière de conduite en état d'ivresse, qui obligera des milliers de primo-délinquants - qu'ils soient fortement ivres ou légèrement au-dessus de la limite légale - à installer dans leurs voitures des dispositifs de test d'alcoolémie qui peuvent verrouiller le contact. Les dispositifs fonctionnent ainsi : le conducteur doit souffler dans un appareil d'alcoolémie relié au contact de la voiture. Si le résultat est supérieur à la limite légale, la voiture ne démarrera pas. L'appareil exige également des ""retests aléatoires"" une fois que le conducteur est sur la route.

La loi actuelle de Virginie exige uniquement que les récidivistes de la conduite en état d'ivresse ou ceux dont le taux d'alcoolémie est égal ou supérieur à 0,15 aient un dispositif d'antidémarrage dans leur voiture.

La nouvelle loi, qui entrera en vigueur en juillet, augmentera d'environ quatre fois le nombre de personnes tenues d'utiliser des dispositifs d'antidémarrage, et les contrevenants devront payer environ 480 $ pour une installation typique de six mois.

La mesure a suscité un débat entre les groupes qui luttent contre la conduite en état d'ivresse et ceux qui représentent les contrevenants. Des groupes comme Mothers Against Drunk Driving et le Washington Regional Alcohol Program affirment que les 274 décès liés à l'alcool sur la route et plus de 5 500 blessés en Virginie en 2010 sont restés inacceptables malgré des années de répression contre la conduite en état d'ivresse. Les dispositifs d'antidémarrage, disent-ils, réduisent les récidives. Mais certains défenseurs publics et avocats soutiennent que les dispositifs constituent une peine trop sévère pour les contrevenants atteignant la limite légale d'alcoolémie de 0,08, et que le système judiciaire sera surchargé par un plus grand nombre de cas devant être jugés et que les conducteurs à faibles revenus seront touchés par les frais.

Le député Sal R. Iaquinto, qui a parrainé le projet de loi, a eu une réponse simple aux inquiétudes concernant le coût des dispositifs d'antidémarrage : ""Combien coûte une vie ?"" ""Souffler dans un tube pendant six mois, vous vous en souviendrez"", a déclaré Iaquinto, ""et vous n'êtes pas susceptible de recommencer.""

"Beaucoup d'entre nous aiment le faire : vous allumez la caméra de votre téléphone portable et la tenez à un angle élevé - ce qui rend vos yeux plus grands et vos pommettes plus définies. Vous vous tournez vers votre meilleur profil et cliquez.
Voilà - votre selfie.
Au cours de la dernière année, ""selfie"" est devenu un terme bien connu dans le monde entier. En août dernier, le dictionnaire Oxford a ajouté le mot à son dictionnaire en ligne et le définit comme : ""Une photographie que l'on a prise de soi-même, généralement avec un smartphone ou une webcam et téléchargée sur un site de médias sociaux.""
Aujourd'hui, il n'est pas difficile de trouver des pages de réseaux sociaux remplies de photos que les gens ont prises d'eux-mêmes et de leurs amis. Et la culture du selfie est devenue particulièrement pertinente pour les jeunes. Selon une enquête récente du Pew Research Center américain, pas moins de 91 % des adolescents ont publié des photos d'eux-mêmes en ligne.
Alors, quelles sont les raisons de l'essor de la culture du selfie ?
""La folie du selfie célèbre les gens ordinaires"", a déclaré Pamela Rutledge, professeure à la Massachusetts School of Professional Psychology, au magazine Vogue. ""Il y a maintenant beaucoup plus de photographies disponibles de vraies personnes que de mannequins.""
Publier des selfies vous permet également de contrôler votre image en ligne. ""J'aime avoir le pouvoir de choisir mon apparence, même si je fais une grimace"", a déclaré Samantha Barks, 19 ans, lycéenne aux États-Unis, à Vogue.
En plus de l'expression personnelle et de la documentation, les selfies ""permettent une amitié étroite pour les amis à distance, car vous pouvez voir leurs visages tous les jours"", a écrit Casey Miller dans The Huffington Post.
Mais la psychologue américaine Jill Weber s'inquiète du fait que les selfies puissent conduire à des problèmes sociaux. ""Il y a un danger que votre estime de soi commence à être liée aux commentaires et aux 'likes' que vous recevez lorsque vous publiez un selfie, et qu'ils ne soient pas basés sur qui vous êtes - ils sont basés sur votre apparence"", a déclaré Weber à Vogue. ""Lorsque vous ne recevez rien ou une réponse négative, votre confiance peut diminuer.""

"Un sac à main contenant un million de dollars de bijoux était en route vers son propriétaire au Canada après avoir été oublié sur un banc dans une ville près de San Francisco, a déclaré la police.

Shahla Ghannadian avait confié son sac à main Louis Vuitton de 2 000 dollars et son précieux contenu à son mari après qu'ils se soient arrêtés à un salon de crème glacée dans la ville de Sunday, selon les autorités.

Il l'a laissé sur un banc près d'un parking du centre-ville, et l'oubli n'a pas été remarqué avant que le couple ne soit de retour à son hôtel, a déclaré le sergent de la police de Sausalito, Kurtis Skoog.

Le couple avait voyagé de Toronto à San Francisco pour le mariage d'une fille.

Le sac à main contenait une montre Cartier, de l'argent liquide et des bijoux portés par la mère et la mariée lors de la cérémonie, a déclaré Skoog.

Les pierres précieuses comprenaient des émeraudes, des perles et des diamants, dont l'un était une pierre de 12 carats, selon la police.

Ghannadian et son mari ont fait un peu de tourisme avant de prendre un vol de retour au Canada dimanche soir. Des membres de la famille ont vérifié le banc, mais le sac à main avait disparu.

John Suhroff, résident de la région, s'est présenté au commissariat de police le lendemain avec le sac, son contenu intact, a déclaré Skoog.

Suhroff a remis le sac à un employé, en disant qu'il contenait ""soit des bijoux de costume, soit des bijoux de pacotille"". ""Nous avons contacté la propriétaire. et elle était ravie"", a déclaré Skoog.

"En adoptant quelques techniques simples, les parents qui lisent à leurs enfants peuvent grandement développer leurs compétences linguistiques. C'est surprenant, mais vrai. La façon dont les parents parlent à leurs enfants fait une grande différence dans le développement du langage des enfants. Si un parent encourage l'enfant à répondre activement à ce qu'il lit, les compétences linguistiques de l'enfant augmentent.

Une étude a été menée auprès de 30 enfants de trois ans et de leurs parents. La moitié des enfants ont participé à l'étude expérimentale, l'autre moitié a servi de groupe de contrôle. Dans le groupe expérimental, les parents ont reçu une formation de deux heures et on leur a appris à poser des questions ouvertes plutôt que des questions à choix multiples. Par exemple, le parent devrait demander ""Que fait le toutou ?"" plutôt que ""Le toutou s'enfuit-il ?"" Les parents du groupe expérimental ont également reçu des instructions sur la façon d'aider les enfants à trouver des réponses, de suggérer différentes possibilités et de féliciter les bonnes réponses.

Au début de l'étude, les enfants ne différaient pas en termes de développement du langage, mais à la fin d'un mois, les enfants du groupe expérimental ont montré un avancement de 5,5 mois par rapport au groupe de contrôle lors d'un test d'expression et de vocabulaire. Neuf mois plus tard, les enfants du groupe expérimental présentaient toujours une avance de 6 mois sur les enfants du groupe de contrôle.

"En 2003, Bethany Hamilton, âgée de 13 ans, a perdu son bras gauche lors d'une attaque de requin alors qu'elle faisait du surf au large de Kauai, à Hawaï. Un nouveau film, Soul Surfer, est basé sur l'histoire de la façon dont elle a surmonté cet événement pour réaliser son rêve de devenir une athlète professionnelle.

Ayant grandi sur l'« île jardin » de Kauai, Hamilton passait chaque minute possible à surfer sur les vagues. Elle était sur le point de devenir une compétitrice de haut niveau dans le surf professionnel. Mais alors qu'elle s'entraînait dans une crique isolée, un requin tigre de quatre mètres de long lui a arraché le bras gauche. Bien que sa vie ait été sauvée, personne n'aurait pu imaginer qu'elle remonterait un jour sur une planche de surf.

Dans une véritable épreuve de sa foi et de sa force de volonté, Bethany est remontée sur une planche de surf seulement un mois après l'attaque. Six mois plus tard, elle concourait à nouveau. Bethany Hamilton a remporté son premier championnat amateur de surf seulement deux ans après avoir perdu son bras. Elle a également créé ""Friends of Bethany"", une fondation à but non lucratif dédiée au soutien des victimes d'attaques de requins.

C'est une histoire racontée dans son autobiographie, qui est à la base du film mettant en vedette l'adolescente Anna Sophia Robb. « Je connaissais l'histoire de Bethany, bien sûr, mais je me suis dit : ""Quel rôle incroyable"" », explique Robb. « J'étais tellement fascinée par tous les défis. Qu'est-ce que ça ferait de perdre son bras, ce qui se passerait dans sa tête et comment sa foi serait mise à l'épreuve ? »

Les cinéastes ont utilisé des effets spéciaux pour retirer numériquement le bras de Robb. Cependant, aucun trucage n'a été nécessaire pour les scènes de surf car Hamilton a elle-même réalisé les chevauchées de vagues à couper le souffle.

Aujourd'hui âgée de 21 ans, Hamilton espère que le public trouvera de l'inspiration dans la description du sport qu'elle aime.

« Peu de gens connaissent vraiment le surf, alors j'espère qu'ils seront éduqués à ce sujet », déclare Hamilton. « Et surtout, si les gens traversent une période difficile, qu'ils puissent être encouragés et trouver de l'inspiration pour surmonter ces difficultés et voir que, dans mon cas, tellement de bonnes choses en sont sorties. »

"Contrairement à ce que l'on pensait auparavant, ce n'est pas la préférence alimentaire mais la pénurie de nourriture qui motive les oiseaux à migrer sur des milliers de kilomètres entre leurs zones de reproduction et leurs zones de non-reproduction chaque année, selon une nouvelle étude.

""Ce n'est pas ce que vous mangez, des insectes, des fruits ou des barres chocolatées, ni où vous les mangez qui compte, mais la fiabilité de cette source de nourriture au jour le jour"", a déclaré la responsable de l'étude, W. Alice Boyle, de l'université d'Arizona.

Pour déterminer la pression sous-jacente qui incite certains oiseaux à quitter leur habitat pour la saison, Boyle a examiné 379 espèces apparentées de gobemouches du Nouveau Monde et a comparé leurs tailles, leurs types de nourriture, leurs habitats, leurs comportements migratoires et s'ils se nourrissaient en groupes.

Pour comparer les oiseaux, les chercheurs ont construit un ""superarbre"" montrant les relations évolutives exactes entre les différentes espèces.

Une analyse informatique a ensuite déterminé si une espèce particulière était migratrice parce qu'elle était ""héréditaire"" ou si quelque chose dans l'environnement de l'oiseau le forçait à quitter chaque saison. Boyle et ses collègues ont découvert que la pénurie de nourriture était le principal facteur qui prédisait le comportement migratoire d'une espèce. ""La disponibilité de la nourriture est la pression sous-jacente, et non le régime alimentaire et l'habitat"", a déclaré Boyle.

Une stratégie alternative que les oiseaux utilisent pour gérer la pénurie de nourriture est de chasser en groupe, car un groupe est plus susceptible de trouver une nouvelle source de nourriture qu'un individu.

""Si vous souffrez de pénurie de nourriture, vous avez deux options"", a déclaré Boyle. ""Vous pouvez soit chasser avec d'autres oiseaux, soit migrer.""

"Deux scientifiques américains ont déclaré aux habitants des pays industrialisés qu'ils seraient beaucoup plus en bonne santé s'ils consommaient davantage des mêmes types d'aliments que ceux consommés par les humains vivant il y a plus de 10 000 ans.

Les scientifiques affirment que le corps humain a très peu changé depuis l'apparition de l'homme sur Terre, mais notre mode de vie a considérablement évolué. Notre corps n'a pas été en mesure de faire face à ces changements de style de vie, ce qui a conduit à de nouveaux types de maladies. Ces nouvelles maladies n'étaient pas connues dans les temps anciens. On les appelle donc ""maladies de civilisation"". De nombreux cancers et maladies du système sanguin, notamment les crises cardiaques et les accidents vasculaires cérébraux, sont des exemples de ces maladies.

Les scientifiques ont constaté que les peuples de la préhistoire utilisaient très peu d'alcool ou de tabac, probablement aucun. Les peuples anciens pratiquaient également beaucoup d'exercice physique, mais un changement alimentaire est l'une des principales différences entre la vie à l'époque antique et la vie d'aujourd'hui.

Les peuples de la préhistoire chassaient les animaux sauvages pour leur viande, qui contenait beaucoup moins de graisse que celle des animaux d'élevage. Ils mangeaient également beaucoup de légumes sauvages frais et de fruits. Ils n'utilisaient pas de lait ni d'autres produits laitiers, et ils utilisaient très peu de céréales. Mais aujourd'hui, nous consommons une grande quantité de produits laitiers et de céréales. Nous mangeons six fois plus de sel que les peuples de la préhistoire. Nous mangeons plus de sucre. Nous consommons deux fois plus de graisses mais seulement un tiers de protéines et beaucoup moins de vitamine C.

Les gens d'aujourd'hui ne souhaitent probablement pas vivre comme les gens il y a des milliers d'années, mais les scientifiques affirment que nous serions beaucoup plus en bonne santé si nous mangions comme ces peuples anciens, en réduisant la quantité d'aliments gras, salés et sucrés.

"Les enfants et les adolescents qui passent beaucoup de temps devant les écrans, en particulier la télévision, sont plus susceptibles de prendre du poids en vieillissant. C'est ce qu'indique une nouvelle étude.

Ces résultats concordent avec des recherches suggérant que toute cette sédentarité et le visionnage constant de publicités peuvent entraîner de mauvaises habitudes alimentaires.

Les chercheurs se sont basés sur les résultats d'une étude à long terme menée auprès d'enfants qui ont répondu à des questionnaires tous les deux ans. Les enfants avaient entre 9 et 16 ans au début de l'étude. Parmi les 4 300 filles de l'étude, 17 % étaient en surpoids ou obèses. Vingt-quatre pour cent des 3 500 garçons étaient également au-dessus d'un poids santé.

Les questionnaires comprenaient des questions sur leur taille et leur poids, ainsi que sur le temps passé à regarder la télévision et les DVD et à jouer aux jeux informatiques et vidéo.

D'une enquête à l'autre, chaque augmentation d'une heure du visionnage quotidien de la télévision chez les enfants était associée à une augmentation d'environ 0,1 point sur l'indice de masse corporelle (IMC), qui mesure le poids en fonction de la taille. Cela représente une différence d'environ un quart de livre par heure supplémentaire de télévision.

""Le poids des preuves est si fort que le visionnage de la télévision est associé à des changements de poids malsains chez les jeunes"", déclare Jennifer Falbe, qui a dirigé l'étude alors qu'elle était à la Harvard School of Public Health à Boston.

""Il est important que les parents connaissent tous les écrans responsables de l'obésité qui doivent vraiment être limités dans la vie de leurs enfants"", déclare Falbe. ""Lorsque les enfants regardent la télévision, il y a beaucoup de publicités alimentaires à la télévision qui pourraient les amener à manger un cookie ou à boire un soda.""

"L'île de Mykonos en automne et en hiver est paisible et magnifique. Elle est parfaite pour un séjour relaxant ou une courte visite. Vous pouvez profiter du ciel bleu, des vastes plages et faire de merveilleuses promenades dans les collines, peut-être pas tous les jours, mais généralement jusqu'au début du mois de janvier. Les visiteurs et les touristes d'hiver viennent souvent à Mykonos pour découvrir l'île grecque traditionnelle. Ils peuvent échapper à l'agitation d'Athènes après le travail, ou se détendre après une longue tournée européenne avant de poursuivre leur voyage vers l'Égypte, Israël ou l'Asie.

En plus des touristes plus habituels, vous trouverez sur cette île de nombreux randonneurs, promeneurs, lecteurs, écrivains, cyclistes, etc. Vous pouvez également visiter la magnifique Délos, faire de la randonnée dans les montagnes, vous promener sur les plages, explorer un autre côté de la vie insulaire avec des monastères, faire de l'équitation ou participer à des rassemblements locaux et rencontrer des Myconiens sympathiques.

Le climat de Mykonos est méditerranéen et doux. L'automne est toujours ensoleillé et avec un ciel bleu, où les températures ne baissent que très progressivement. Les belles journées de plage et de baignade durent jusqu'à début janvier. Les vrais mois d'hiver sont également doux. Même en janvier, les températures ne descendent jamais très bas. L'île bénéficie d'un taux élevé de _ grâce aux vents du sud-est et aux précipitations entre la mi-janvier et la mi-mars ; il existe également une possibilité de tempêtes et de vents froids du nord pendant cette période.

"Si vous mettez un vautour dans un enclos de six à huit pieds carrés entièrement ouvert en haut, l'oiseau, malgré sa capacité à voler, sera un prisonnier. La raison en est qu'un vautour commence toujours un vol du sol avec une course de dix à douze pieds. Sans espace pour courir, il ne tentera même pas de voler, mais restera prisonnier à vie dans une petite prison sans toit.

La chauve-souris ordinaire qui vole la nuit, une créature remarquablement agile dans l'air, ne peut pas décoller d'un endroit plat. Si elle est placée sur le sol ou sur un sol plat, tout ce qu'elle peut faire est de se débattre inutilement et, sans aucun doute, douloureusement, jusqu'à ce qu'elle atteigne une certaine hauteur d'où elle peut se lancer dans l'air. Puis, immédiatement, elle décolle comme un éclair.

Un bourdon, s'il est lâché dans un verre à pied ouvert, y restera jusqu'à ce qu'il meure, à moins qu'il ne soit sorti. Il ne voit jamais le moyen d'échapper en haut, mais insiste pour essayer de trouver une issue par les côtés près du fond. Il cherchera un chemin où il n'en existe pas jusqu'à ce qu'il se détruise complètement.

"Gabriela Mistral est née le 6 avril 1889 à Vicuña, une petite ville du nord du Chili. Ses parents étaient instituteurs, mais son père a abandonné la famille lorsqu'elle avait 3 ans. Enseignée par sa mère, elle a commencé à enseigner en 1904, remportant du succès dans de nombreux lycées. En 1909, son premier amour est mort. Peu de temps après, son second amour s'est marié à quelqu'un d'autre. En 1922, le ministre mexicain de l'éducation, José Vasconcelos, l'a invitée à l'aider dans son programme de réforme, et le sommet de cette carrière est survenu l'année suivante, lorsqu'elle a reçu le titre chilien de ""Professeur de la Nation"". En 1925, elle a pris sa retraite mais est restée active.

Gabriela Mistral a consacré beaucoup de temps à l'activité diplomatique, servant de consul honoraire à Madrid, Lisbonne, Nice et Los Angeles. Elle a également été représentante aux Nations Unies. Dans l'exercice de ces responsabilités, elle a visité presque tous les pays importants d'Europe et d'Amérique latine. Elle a également poursuivi ses activités littéraires précoces.

En 1922, le premier livre de Gabriela Mistral, Desolation, une collection de poèmes précédemment publiés dans des journaux et des magazines, a été publié grâce aux efforts de Federico de Onis, directeur de l'Institut hispanique de New York. Il reflétait la tristesse personnelle.

Deux ans plus tard, son second livre, Tendresse, est paru ; il contenait quelques-uns des poèmes de Desolation et plusieurs nouveaux. Quatorze années se sont écoulées avant l'apparition du suivant, Sentiment. Il était beaucoup plus joyeux sur le ton.

Son dernier livre, Pressoir, en 1954, traitait de la plupart des sujets déjà abordés mais d'une manière différente. La victoire du prix Nobel de littérature en 1945 n'a pas apaisé la perte de son neveu. De plus, en 1944, elle avait développé un diabète.

Gabriela Mistral s'est rendue aux États-Unis pour obtenir une aide médicale en 1946, vivant à différents endroits et, après sa nomination aux Nations Unies, déménageant à Long Island. C'est là qu'elle est morte d'un cancer le 10 janvier 1957.

"Dans le gymnase de l'école communautaire de Croxteth à Liverpool, 50 garçons ont terminé un cours de boxe considéré comme un pilote pour son retour dans les écoles publiques.
La Schools Amateur Boxing Association (SABA) a développé le programme Kid Gloves ( ), une version sans contact du sport où des entraîneurs externes enseignent une variété de compétences de base.
Chris Andrews, secrétaire adjoint de la SABA, a déclaré que le programme était considéré comme un moyen de renverser le déclin de la boxe dans les écoles publiques qui a commencé il y a 25 ans.
Les craintes de sécurité et la mauvaise image de la boxe professionnelle ont accéléré le déclin du sport. L'inquiétude a été aggravée par des incidents tels que la mort du boxeur professionnel Bradley Stone. Mais l'exemple de Croxteth gagnait de plus en plus de partisans. M. Andrews a déclaré que l'idée était particulièrement bien accueillie dans le nord-est de l'Angleterre.
""L'intérêt manifesté jusqu'à présent a été énorme"", a-t-il déclaré. ""Je crois que la boxe reviendra dans les écoles. Une vidéo a été produite pour promouvoir la boxe dans les écoles, et une demande de subvention du Conseil des sports a été faite.""
Il a déclaré : ""Je pense qu'il y a une reconnaissance réelle qu'il y a des aspects à la boxe, si elle est contrôlée et bien gérée, qui sont vraiment très bénéfiques pour les enfants. Ce programme élimine les dangers. J'espère que la boxe peut être promue dans tout le pays de manière plus coordonnée."" Une telle idée horrifie des groupes comme l'Association médicale britannique (BMA) et le Conseil britannique de la sécurité, tous deux critiques de l'idée.
Le Dr Jeffrey Cundy, coauteur d'un rapport de la BMA sur la boxe, a admis que le programme à Liverpool était sans contact, mais il était toujours opposé. Il a déclaré : ""Nous estimons que les enfants ne devraient toujours pas être initiés à la boxe, car ils seront ensuite encouragés à pratiquer une activité qui est uniquement dangereuse lorsque le contact réel a lieu.""
Il a ajouté : ""Il existe toute une gamme de sports qui enseigneront la discipline qui découle de la boxe sans les dangers. Nous considérons cette réintroduction dans les écoles comme un développement malsain.""
Dans l'école de Croxteth, qui compte 800 élèves, Steve Stewart, responsable de l'EPS, a déclaré que la boxe avait contribué à améliorer la confiance en soi, la discipline, la conscience de soi et le respect de soi chez les participants. Tout le monde pouvait participer et, comme tout le monde partait de zéro, les améliorations pouvaient être constatées rapidement.
Des certificats ont été remis aux élèves à la fin du cours par Paul Hodgkinson, un boxeur local qui est un ancien champion du monde. L'année prochaine, le cours sera répété et si possible, les filles seront autorisées à y participer à la suite de demandes de leur part.
Gerry Thompson et Tony Curry, tous deux âgés de 12 ans, ont apprécié les séances de boxe et disent qu'ils rejoindront tous les deux un club de boxe local. ""J'ai trouvé ça génial"", a déclaré Gerry. ""Je préférerais être un boxeur professionnel qu'un footballeur. C'est plus agréable*""

Les moyens actuels d'accéder au Paradis impliquent divers systèmes surnaturels pour lesquels, à ce stade, il n'y a aucune preuve scientifique. Je pense donc que nous pouvons réduire le Paradis à un projet d'ingénierie que nous réalisons. La demande pour le Paradis est grande - témoin le désir de tous les cœurs humains, des personnes qui ont construit les pyramides anciennes à la société moderne, de vivre au-delà de son temps donné. Notre plan est de changer la conscience humaine du cerveau à des bits d'informations dans une puce informatique, ou un autre type de support informatique, afin que par la simple pensée, nous puissions créer notre propre monde personnel.

"Cob est un garçon de six ans. Une organisation d'aide l'a amené à la ferme gérée par Joy, depuis une autre province. Les parents de Cob sont tous les deux morts d'une maladie grave lorsqu'il était un bébé de deux mois. Sa grand-mère de quatre-vingts ans le traitait mal. Au fil du temps, il a développé une maladie qui l'a empêché de bien se souvenir des choses ; d'un autre côté, il n'y avait rien de bon à retenir non plus.

Lorsqu'il est arrivé à la ferme pour la première fois, elle lui est apparue comme une immense aire de jeux. Cob a joué partout, s'est caché derrière les arbres et les buissons, et a apprécié ce nouvel environnement.

Au fil du temps, il a gagné en confiance, a choisi Joy comme sa nouvelle mère et s'est laissé porter par elle. Amy, la vraie fille de Joy, du même âge que Cob, a dû apprendre à partager sa mère avec l'autre enfant. Elle a également dû considérer les autres enfants comme ses frères ou sœurs et les accepter, même si elle n'était peut-être pas disposée à le faire.

Au début, Cob n'utilisait pas les installations de la ferme. Joy a lentement essayé de l'aider à les utiliser, et pendant la journée, il les utilisait, mais pas la nuit. Toutes les tentatives pour l'envoyer à l'école ont échoué. Dès qu'il y arrivait, il s'enfuyait dans le grand monde comme un lapin libre. Il aimait courir dans l'école plutôt que de faire ce que les professeurs lui disaient de faire. Finalement, le directeur a annoncé que l'école ne convenait pas à Cob.

Cob a dû retourner à la ferme. Le jour, il observait les adultes et les enfants plus âgés faire du vélo, et s'il en avait l'occasion, il prenait un vélo, puis le poussait et le tirait de haut en bas de la colline. Un jour, Cob a trouvé un petit vélo à côté des grands. C'était un cadeau pour lui ! Il était neuf, avec des roues de chaque côté de la roue arrière, ce qui était parfait pour un petit enfant sans aucune expérience de la conduite d'un vélo. Cob l'a poussé jusqu'en haut de la colline, il est monté dessus et est descendu de temps en temps.

À partir de ce moment, Cob a commencé à faire du vélo tous les jours. Même s'il tombait souvent et se blessait, il continuait. Pendant les jours de pluie, il rangeait son vélo dans sa chambre et dormait près de lui la nuit. Peut-être que même dans ses rêves, il était heureux - il avait trouvé l'entrée d'une vie heureuse et satisfaisante.

"Le Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) est une université de recherche privée située à Cambridge, dans le Massachusetts, fondée en 1861 en réponse à l'industrialisation croissante des États-Unis. L'institut mettait l'accent sur l'enseignement en laboratoire dans les domaines des sciences appliquées et de l'ingénierie. L'accent mis par le MIT sur les technologies appliquées aux niveaux undergraduate et postgraduate a conduit à une étroite collaboration avec l'industrie. Les réformes curriculaires menées par Karl Compton et Vannevar Bush dans les années 1930 ont mis l'accent sur les sciences fondamentales. Le MIT a été élu à l'Association of American Universities en 1934. Aujourd'hui, l'institut comprend différents départements universitaires avec un fort accent sur l'éducation et la recherche scientifiques, techniques et technologiques.

Le MIT est l'une des institutions d'enseignement supérieur les plus sélectives et a reçu 18 357 candidatures au baccalauréat pour la classe de 2018, n'en admettant que 1 419, soit un taux d'admission de 7,73 %.

Le campus du MIT, d'une superficie de 168 acres, s'étend sur environ un mile sur le côté nord du bassin de la rivière Charles, dans la ville de Cambridge. Le campus est divisé en deux parties à peu près égales par Massachusetts Avenue, avec la plupart des dortoirs et des installations de vie étudiante à l'ouest et la plupart des bâtiments universitaires à l'est. Le réacteur nucléaire du MIT sur le campus est l'un des réacteurs nucléaires universitaires les plus puissants des États-Unis. En 1999, Bill Gates a fait don de 20 millions de dollars au MIT pour la construction d'un laboratoire informatique appelé ""William H. Gates Building"". Si Microsoft avait déjà apporté un soutien financier à l'institution, il s'agissait du premier don personnel reçu de Gates.

"Il est difficile de dire exactement comment la musique que nous appelons ""rock"" ou ""rock and roll"" a commencé. Ses racines remontent à de nombreux pays différents, à de nombreux types de musique différents et à de nombreux musiciens.
La musique rock s'est développée principalement à partir de l'interaction entre la musique africaine noire et la musique européenne blanche. Les Européens et les esclaves africains qui sont arrivés en Amérique au XVIIe siècle avaient chacun leurs propres types de musique. Les Africains noirs utilisaient des rythmes de batterie lourds, une voix chantée rauque et l'appel d'une mélodie et la réponse d'un chœur. Les Européens blancs, principalement anglais et écossais, utilisaient une mélodie plus forte, un rythme moins lourd et des instruments tels que des guitares, des cuivres et des violons. L'histoire du rock and roll est l'histoire de la manière dont le rock a évolué à partir de ces deux traditions.
Du XVIIe au XXe siècle, les musiciens du sud des États-Unis ont développé deux nouvelles formes de musique : le blues, généralement joué par les Noirs, et la musique country, jouée par les Blancs. Les musiciens noirs chantaient le blues avec une guitare. Cette musique ressemblait aux chants de travail : des récits de problèmes et de douleurs, avec des lignes répétées plusieurs fois. L'expression ""rock and roll"" vient probablement des églises noires du Sud, où les gens chantaient et dansaient sur les rythmes forts qu'ils appelaient ""rocking and reeling"". En même temps, les Blancs jouaient de la musique country, qui était principalement de la musique de danse traditionnelle et des chansons lentes qui racontaient des histoires tristes. Les chanteurs jouaient avec des instruments à cordes comme des violons et des guitares.
Pendant cette période, les musiciens de blues et de country ont eu une certaine influence l'un sur l'autre, mais cette influence s'est renforcée après que les disques phonographiques sont devenus populaires à la fin du XIXe siècle. La naissance de la guitare électrique a changé la musique country et le blues dans les années 1940. Le son de la guitare électrique allait devenir le son du rock and roll. Personne ne pense au rock and roll des débuts sans penser à Elvis Presley, le ""Roi du rock and roll"". La musique rock continue de se développer et de changer, mais le cœur et l'âme du rock sont les mêmes que ceux qu'Elvis a exprimés.

Nous avons ajouté de l'eau. Puis plus de farine. Puis plus d'eau. À ce moment-là, la masse de notre pâte avait beaucoup augmenté.
""Placer la pâte sur une surface farinée et la presser jusqu'à ce qu'elle soit lisse"", indiquait la recette.
Nous avons travaillé à tour de rôle en enfonçant nos mains dans la pâte humide, en la pinçant, en la pressant et en la sentant s'échapper entre nos doigts.
""Nettoyer et huiler le bol, puis remettre la pâte dans le bol. Couvrir et laisser lever la pâte dans un endroit chaud pendant 1 heure.""
C'était une bonne nouvelle, nous allions avoir une pause. Sur des chaises de cuisine sales, nous avons rêvé de notre beau pain. ""Tu vois ?"" dirions-nous à ma mère. ""Ça vaut la peine de faire tout ce travail, non ?""
Hanna et moi ne pouvions pas nous empêcher de regarder le processus de levée toutes les quelques minutes. Mais rien ne se passait.
""Peut-être que quelque chose va se passer dans le four chaud"", ai-je dit.
Malheureusement, lorsque nous avons retiré les pains du four, ils ressemblaient à des pierres dures.
Maman avait raison ; ça prend du temps et des efforts. Ça fait parfois des dégâts. Mais quand même, c'est bien, d'une certaine façon, de faire partie de cette longue chaîne de boulangers qui dure depuis toujours. Depuis cette nuit-là, Hanna et moi avons toutes les deux appris à faire les choses correctement.

"Chère Karen,

Comme tu le sais probablement, c'est l'anniversaire de ma sœur Suzie dans une semaine, elle aura 16 ans. On lui prépare une fête surprise. Julie va la chercher à l'école comme d'habitude vendredi, mais elle ne la ramènera pas à la maison. Elle l'emmènera au Palace Hotel, le grand hôtel moderne près de la gare. On va y dîner et on a aussi réservé la salle de bal pour une fête le soir. J'espère que tu pourras venir !

Tous ses amis de l'école viennent et pas mal de gens de notre village aussi. Bien sûr, Maman et Papa viennent d'Angleterre et j'ai réussi à persuader notre autre sœur, Marie, de venir d'Australie. Elle amène ses enfants avec elle.

Après la fête, on en organisera une autre samedi ! Enfin, pas vraiment une fête. On invite la famille et les amis proches (ce qui inclut toi) pour un repas à la maison. S'il fait beau, on aimerait faire un barbecue dans le jardin. Julie va faire un gâteau spécial pour Suzie.

Bref, on espère faire de ce week-end un moment vraiment spécial pour Suzie. Dimanche, on va tous se promener à la campagne. Tu sais qu'elle adore marcher et on aura tous besoin d'un peu d'exercice après tous ces bons repas. On espère aller jusqu'au lac. Marie a dit qu'elle voulait que ses enfants nourrissent les canards, tout comme Suzie le faisait lorsqu'ils étaient très jeunes. Je suis sûre que Suzie adorera ça aussi.

Ce serait formidable si tu pouvais venir pour le week-end. On serait tous ravis de te voir.

Fais-moi savoir dès que possible.

Meilleures salutations,

David

"La mer a toujours intéressé l'homme. Il peut y trouver de la nourriture, des minéraux et des trésors. Pendant des milliers d'années, il a pu naviguer sur la mer. Mais il ne pouvait pas aller bien loin sous sa surface.
L'homme veut explorer les profondeurs de la mer. Cependant, il n'est pas un poisson. Il doit respirer de l'air, il ne peut donc pas rester longtemps sous la surface de l'eau. Pour explorer les eaux profondes, l'homme est confronté à encore plus de dangers et de problèmes.
Un plongeur qui veut rester sous l'eau plus de quelques minutes doit respirer de l'air ou un mélange spécial de gaz. Il peut porter une combinaison de plongée et se faire pomper de l'air par le haut. Il peut porter une bouteille d'air sur son dos et respirer par le nez et un embout buccal. L'eau pèse 800 fois plus que l'air. Des tonnes d'eau poussent un plongeur dans les profondeurs de la mer. Son corps est soumis à une forte pression.
Lorsqu'un plongeur est soumis à une forte pression, son sang absorbe une partie des gaz qu'il respire. Lorsqu'il remonte à la surface, la pression de l'eau diminue. Si le plongeur remonte trop vite, les gaz présents dans son sang forment des bulles.","{

"La lecture est un excellent passe-temps pour de nombreuses raisons. Premièrement, la lecture est amusante. Vous pouvez toujours vous divertir si vous aimez lire. Vous ne vous ennuierez jamais ni ne vous fatiguerez. Ensuite, vous pouvez lire un livre n'importe où : dans une voiture, dans un avion, ou même dans la salle de bain. Tout ce qu'il vous faut, c'est un livre ! Une autre bonne raison de lire est que c'est utile. Si vous lisez en tant que passe-temps, vous vous améliorerez de plus en plus. Vous lirez plus vite et trouverez plus facile de comprendre ce que vous lisez. À mesure que vos compétences en lecture s'améliorent, vous constaterez probablement que vos résultats scolaires s'améliorent également.

Certaines personnes disent que la lecture est dépassée. Ce n'est pas vrai. Vous pouvez lire sur des ordinateurs, et plus vous lisez, plus vos compétences informatiques s'améliorent. Les bons lecteurs peuvent aussi devenir des écrivains. Ils ont toujours plus de choses à écrire.

"  Il est temps pour les élèves de vendre des choses comme des barres chocolatées et des cartes de vœux pour collecter des fonds pour leur école, leur classe ou leur club. Il est _ qu'ils vont frapper à votre porte et que vous allez facilement leur donner votre argent pour des articles surévalués que vous ne voulez pas vraiment. C'est bien, cependant, car il y a de nombreuses raisons pour lesquelles les enfants devraient être autorisés à collecter des fonds pour leurs écoles et leurs clubs.
La collecte de fonds est un excellent moyen d'aider les enfants à apprendre des compétences sociales. Ce n'est pas facile d'aller voir un inconnu et de lui demander son argent. Ils doivent demander de l'aide gentiment, montrer à l'acheteur intéressé ce qu'ils ont à offrir et expliquer comment cela les aidera à l'école. Si quelqu'un refuse d'acheter un article, l'enfant doit accepter l'échec avec philosophie, et c'est aussi une leçon à retenir.
Les élèves peuvent apprendre à gérer l'argent en collectant des fonds. Bien sûr, il peut sembler plus sûr pour nous de prendre en charge les gains de nos enfants provenant de leurs collectes de fonds avant qu'ils ne soient remis à l'école. Cependant, en les faisant suivre, compter et s'assurer que tout le monde paie le bon montant, ils apprennent une leçon importante. Gérer l'argent est important à savoir quand ils seront plus âgés.
La collecte de fonds contribue à améliorer leurs écoles. C'est l'école des enfants. Ils doivent y apprendre et y grandir. Pourquoi ne pas les laisser aider à en faire un meilleur endroit ?
La collecte de fonds permet aux enfants de vivre plus d'expériences. L'argent collecté est utilisé pour des choses comme des fêtes, des voyages ou pour que le club de musique aille voir une comédie musicale à Broadway. Les enfants reçoivent les récompenses de leur travail acharné à collecter les fonds. Sans la collecte de fonds, ces sorties et ces souvenirs d'école spéciaux seraient manqués.
En un mot, la collecte de fonds aide beaucoup les enfants de nombreuses façons.

"Si vous entendez le son d'un combiné qui émet un bip dans un sac ou une poche, vous pourriez être pardonné de penser que quelqu'un a reçu un SMS. Mais de nos jours, il existe tellement de façons différentes de messager quelqu'un que cela pourrait signifier la mort du SMS traditionnel tel que nous le connaissons.

La messagerie texte, ou SMS, est l'art d'envoyer un court message électronique entre deux téléphones mobiles ou tablettes. Les utilisateurs paient un certain montant pour envoyer des messages via SMS - service de messagerie courte. Mais au cours des dernières années, la messagerie de cette manière a été en déclin.

L'essor des smartphones et des tablettes a vu une augmentation de l'utilisation des applications de messagerie instantanée, qui remplacent les SMS traditionnels. En utilisant des connexions Internet sans fil, les gens peuvent envoyer un nombre illimité de MI à leurs amis pour très peu de frais. Contrairement aux SMS mobiles traditionnels, l'utilisateur n'a généralement qu'à payer pour télécharger l'application une fois, après quoi chaque message qu'il envoie est gratuit.

Les développeurs Web ont rapidement remarqué. Les applications de messagerie instantanée sont devenues populaires dans le monde entier. WhatsApp en Amérique et en Europe, WeChat en Chine et Kakao Talk en Corée du Sud ne sont que quelques-unes de celles qui ont attiré des centaines de millions de personnes, qui utilisent les applications pour discuter avec leurs amis en temps réel. Ces applications permettent aux gens d'envoyer gratuitement des messages avec des images, ce qui était auparavant assez coûteux.

La société de recherche Informa a déclaré que près de 19 milliards de messages étaient envoyés par jour à l'aide d'applications de chat en 2012, contre 17,6 milliards de SMS. Et elle s'attend à ce que le marché des applications de chat atteigne 50 milliards par jour d'ici 2014. Cela signifie-t-il vraiment la fin de la communication par SMS ?

Pamela Clark-Dickson d'Informa ne le pense pas. Elle affirme qu'un grand nombre de personnes utilisent des téléphones mobiles normaux, en particulier dans les pays en développement, qui préfèrent l'outil de messagerie SMS. Il existe une base terriblement large d'utilisateurs de téléphones mobiles qui vont encore trouver que le SMS est la meilleure expérience de messagerie pour eux pendant un certain temps.

"Chanter la langue que vous apprenez
Comment pouvez-vous vous souvenir d'une chanson de votre enfance à ce jour ? Pourquoi vos professeurs utilisent-ils des chansons pour vous apprendre l'anglais ? Il semble qu'il y ait une raison scientifique à cela.
Les chercheurs étudient maintenant la relation entre la musique et la mémorisation d'une langue étrangère. Ils constatent que se souvenir des mots d'une chanson est la meilleure façon de se souvenir même des langues les plus difficiles.
""Chanter pourrait être une nouvelle façon d'apprendre une langue étrangère. Le cerveau aime se souvenir des choses lorsqu'elles sont utilisées de manière créative et significative"", a déclaré le Dr Karen Ludke. Les conclusions pourraient aider ceux qui ont des difficultés à apprendre les langues étrangères. Sur son blog, le Dr Ludke écrit : ""Une méthode de chant d'écoute et de répétition peut soutenir l'apprentissage des langues étrangères et ouvre la porte à de futures recherches dans ce domaine.""
De nombreux professeurs de langues connaissent la valeur de l'utilisation de la musique et du chant. Hua Zhuying, professeur dans une école de langue chinoise à Washington, D.C. dépend fortement des chansons pour enseigner le chinois. Elle dit : ""J'utilise la musique tout le temps pour enseigner le chinois aux enfants. Pour les petits, nous utilisons généralement la musique. Non seulement cela fonctionne, mais c'est amusant pour les enfants.""
""Parfois, je pense que si l'on m'avait appris l'anglais de cette façon, peut-être que je pourrais parler beaucoup mieux anglais qu'aujourd'hui"", ajoute Hua Zhuying.
Notre cerveau aime la musique, surtout pour se souvenir. Donc, si vous avez encore du mal à apprendre une langue, pourquoi ne pas essayer de la chanter ?

"L'assurance maladie est une grande préoccupation pour les Américains aujourd'hui. Il est probable que de nombreux Américains manquent d'assurance maladie alors que l'économie ne montre aucun signe de reprise. L'Académie nationale des sciences a rapporté jeudi. ""À moins que l'assurance maladie ne devienne plus abordable, le nombre d'Américains non assurés risque de continuer à augmenter au fil du temps"", a déclaré Mary Sue Coleman, coprésidente du comité qui a rédigé le rapport. Le rapport est le premier des six prévus par l'Institut de médecine sur deux ans. La série est prévue pour découvrir qui manque d'assurance maladie et pourquoi, et pour déterminer quelles sont les conséquences et pour fournir les bases du débat sur la manière de corriger le problème. L'institut fait partie de l'académie, une organisation privée soutenue par le Congrès pour conseiller le gouvernement en matière scientifique. 
Ce premier rapport vise à brosser un tableau des millions de personnes qui manquent d'assurance. Il ne formule aucune recommandation. ""Une grande partie de ce que les Américains pensent savoir sur les non assurés est faux"", a déclaré le Dr Arthur Kellermann, professeur de santé publique à l'École de médecine de l'Université Emory d'Atlanta, qui a également participé à l'élaboration du rapport. Le Bureau du recensement a rapporté le mois dernier que 38,7 millions d'Américains sont restés sans couverture pendant toute l'année 2000, contre 39,3 millions l'année précédente, grâce à l'essor économique. Les experts affirment que la tendance risque de s'inverser cette année, étant donné que l'économie ralentissait déjà avant les attentats terroristes du 11 septembre. ""Malheureusement, le recent ralentissement économique a pu inverser les modestes gains de couverture pour des périodes plus courtes.""
Le rapport indique qu'avec l'augmentation des coûts de l'assurance, davantage d'employeurs et de particuliers pourraient conclure qu'ils sont incapables de se permettre une couverture. Les augmentations des primes étaient souvent absorbées par les employeurs dans la forte économie des années 1990, mais cela pourrait ne pas continuer à mesure que l'économie se ramollit, selon le rapport. Le groupe a constaté qu'environ 13,6 millions de personnes non assurées travaillent pour des employeurs qui n'offrent pas d'assurance maladie. La couverture souscrite à titre individuel peut s'avérer prohibitivement coûteuse.

"Un jour, Frank se promenait avec sa mère lorsqu'ils sont arrivés devant un joli jardin. Frank regarda à l'intérieur et vit qu'il y avait des allées de gravier propres et de belles fleurs.
Il appela sa mère et dit : ""Maman, viens voir ce joli jardin. J'aimerais bien pouvoir ouvrir la porte et entrer.""
Le jardinier entendit ce que dit Frank et l'invita gentiment, lui et sa mère, à entrer dans le jardin.
La mère de Frank remercia l'homme. Puis elle dit à son fils : ""Frank, si je t'emmène te promener dans ce jardin, tu dois faire attention à ne rien toucher.""
Frank marcha le long des allées de gravier bien rangées et regarda tout, mais ne toucha à rien de ce qu'il voyait.

Le jardinier était très content de Frank, car il faisait si attention à bien se conduire. Il lui montra les graines et lui dit le nom de nombreuses fleurs et plantes.
Alors que Frank admirait la beauté d'une fleur, un petit garçon arriva à la porte et, la trouvant fermée à clé, la secoua fortement. Mais elle ne s'ouvrit pas. Alors il dit : ""Laissez-moi entrer. Laissez-moi entrer. Ne me laisserez-vous pas entrer dans ce jardin ?""

"La confiance en soi est très importante dans la vie quotidienne. Elle peut vous aider à développer une attitude positive. Une étude montre que les personnes les plus confiantes sont beaucoup plus heureuses. Elles ont plus de chances de réussir. Mais comment faire pour être plus confiant ? Voici quelques suggestions :

Parlez fort. Lorsque vous n'avez pas confiance en vous, vous ne pouvez pas bien faire ce que vous voulez faire. Vous parlez d'une voix si basse que les autres ne vous entendent pas. Essayez de parler assez fort pour que les gens puissent vous entendre clairement. Une voix haute peut vous aider à devenir plus confiant.

Pratiquez un sport. L'exercice physique vous fatigue mais vous détend complètement. Lorsque vous êtes sportif, vous êtes plein de confiance.

Encouragez-vous. Notez une liste de choses que vous avez faites pendant la journée et voyez combien de choses vous avez bien faites. Avez-vous terminé vos devoirs ? Avez-vous raconté une blague qui a fait rire tout le monde ? Félicitez-vous pour les bonnes choses que vous avez faites.

Débarrassez-vous de la peur. La peur va de pair avec l'échec. Mais il est facile de la surmonter si vous savez que l'échec fait partie de votre vie. Ne cachez pas votre tête juste parce que vous avez dit quelque chose de stupide la dernière fois. Essayez de recommencer et croyez que vous pouvez faire mieux.

Choisissez un passe-temps. Si vous aimez chanter, chantez autant que possible. D'une certaine manière, un passe-temps peut vous rendre exceptionnel. Et cela vous rendra heureux et confiant.

"Quand avez-vous visité un centre commercial pour la dernière fois ? Dans de nombreux endroits, la réponse serait ""le week-end dernier"". Certaines personnes y vont encore plus souvent. Pourquoi ? D'une part, les centres commerciaux proposent des biens et des services dont les gens ont besoin en un seul endroit : nourriture, vêtements, articles pour leur maison, divertissements, voire des services médicaux. Alors, les centres commerciaux sont-ils l'un des points forts de la civilisation moderne ? Les militants écologistes diraient non ! Ils iraient même plus loin et diraient que le comportement des consommateurs est à l'origine d'une catastrophe environnementale majeure.
car les consommateurs ignorent les effets secondaires de leurs achats--l'étalement urbain   .
Les sociologues s'accordent à dire que les modèles de développement ont considérablement modifié le paysage au cours des cinquante dernières années. Avant 1950, la plupart des gens vivaient dans des villes ou des villages et se rendaient au travail à pied ou en transports en commun. Seules les personnes très riches possédaient des automobiles. Les agriculteurs vivaient dans des zones rurales ou des villages isolés et ne se rendaient en ville que lorsqu'ils avaient besoin de choses qu'ils ne pouvaient pas produire eux-mêmes. Si vous regardiez le paysage, vous verriez des villes entourées de campagne. Puis un changement massif s'est produit.
Les automobiles sont devenues abordables et les gens n'ont pas tardé à les adopter. Maintenant, les travailleurs ambitieux pouvaient vivre dans les banlieues, les zones situées juste à l'extérieur des villes, qui ont commencé à se développer rapidement. Tant qu'il y avait beaucoup de terres bon marché dans les banlieues, personne ne s'est beaucoup préoccupé de l'utilisation de ces terres. Les centres commerciaux, les restaurants de fast-food, les cinémas et les concessionnaires automobiles se sont répandus dans de grands bâtiments plats. Ces bâtiments d'un seul étage et leur parking ont occupé beaucoup d'espace. Les agriculteurs bien intentionnés pensaient qu'ils étaient mieux placés pour vendre leurs terres que pour cultiver. Dans leur ignorance, personne ne s'est rendu compte qu'une fois que les terres étaient urbanisées, les bonnes terres agricoles seraient ruinées à jamais. Il n'y avait aucun moyen de les préserver.
Ce n'est que ces dernières années que les gens ont commencé à déplorer l'ancien mode de vie alors qu'ils ont développé une compréhension des problèmes. Maintenant, les gens se rendent compte que l'étalement urbain s'accompagne de sérieux problèmes environnementaux. Les aspects négatifs de l'étalement urbain comprennent la pollution de l'air et de l'eau, la perte de terres agricoles, les embouteillages et la disparition des entreprises dans les anciens centres-villes. De nombreux chercheurs pensent qu'il est temps d'analyser les problèmes plus en profondeur afin de développer des politiques appropriées pour contrôler l'étalement urbain. Certains pensent que la meilleure façon de procéder est d'éduquer les citoyens sur leur environnement précieux.

"Lorsque nous parlons d'intelligence, nous ne faisons pas référence à la capacité à obtenir de bons résultats à certains types de tests, ni même à la capacité à réussir dans les matières scolaires. Par intelligence, nous entendons un mode de vie et de comportement, en particulier dans une situation nouvelle ou bouleversante. Si nous voulons tester l'intelligence, nous devons découvrir comment une personne agit plutôt que ce qu'elle sait faire.

Par exemple, lorsqu'il se trouve dans une situation nouvelle, une personne intelligente réfléchit à la situation, non à elle-même ou à ce qui pourrait lui arriver. Elle essaie de découvrir tout ce qu'elle peut, puis elle agit immédiatement et essaie de faire quelque chose. Elle n'est probablement pas sûre de comment tout cela va se terminer, mais au moins elle essaie. Et si elle ne parvient pas à faire les choses correctement, elle ne se sent pas honteuse d'avoir échoué ; elle essaie simplement d'apprendre de ses erreurs. Une personne intelligente, même si elle est très jeune, a une vision particulière de la vie, un sentiment particulier de la vie et de la façon dont elle s'y intègre.

Si vous observez les enfants, vous constaterez une grande différence entre ce que nous appelons les enfants ""intelligents"" et les enfants ""non intelligents"". Ce sont en fait deux types de personnes différents, pas simplement le même type avec des niveaux d'intelligence différents. Par exemple, l'enfant intelligent veut vraiment découvrir la vie et essaie d'entrer en contact avec tout ce qui l'entoure. Mais l'enfant non intelligent reste plus à lui-même et dans son propre monde de rêve ; il semble y avoir un fossé entre lui et la vie en général.

Pourquoi les plantes semblent toujours se tourner vers la lumière et les plantes grimpantes montent plutôt que de descendre ? La réponse est simple : l'auxine, une substance chimique qui contrôle la croissance des plantes.

L'auxine dévoile ses secrets
L'auxine est une hormone végétale. Darwin s'y intéressait déjà au XIXe siècle. Ce n'est que ces dernières années, cependant, que l'hormone a commencé à dévoiler ses secrets, grâce à des recherches moléculaires intensives. L'auxine est produite dans les parties jeunes et en croissance des plantes, puis transportée dans toute la plante, par exemple vers une tige basse. La tige doit se redresser le plus rapidement possible pour pouvoir absorber la partie supérieure, ce qui entraîne une croissance plus rapide de la partie inférieure et le redressement de la tige. Pour la même raison, les plantes devant des fenêtres se tourneront toujours vers la lumière. Cette régulation active du transport de l'auxine permet aux plantes de tirer parti de manière idéale des conditions locales et changeantes.

Un nouveau moyen de transport pour l'auxine ?
Le transport de l'auxine à travers la plante joue un rôle vital. Et, à toute évidence, ce n'est pas une simple affaire. Les chercheurs ont identifié un nouveau lien important et un nouveau moyen de transport pour l'auxine : les protéines PILS. Les protéines PILS sont essentielles à la croissance des plantes dépendantes de l'auxine et ajustent le stockage intracellulaire de l'hormone. C'est précisément cette compartimentation de l'auxine qui semble fonctionnellement importante pour les différents processus de développement.

Cultiver des cultures plus efficacement : la bonne quantité d'auxine au bon endroit
Des niveaux d'auxine plus élevés au bon moment et au bon endroit se traduisent par une meilleure croissance et une récolte plus importante. Une meilleure adaptation des niveaux d'auxine permettrait aux plantes de pousser plus efficacement. Les chercheurs espèrent contribuer au développement de processus de croissance plus efficaces en continuant à éclaircir les processus de transport de l'auxine.

"La structure bosselée des noix ressemble au cerveau. Certains Chinois pensent qu'en manger les rendra plus intelligents à cause de cela. Par la même logique, ils pensent que manger des cerveaux de porc augmentera leur intelligence. Ce genre de mythe alimentaire est également vrai pour les Américains. Certains Américains mangent régulièrement des œufs crus pour garder leur esprit vif.

La plupart des médecins ne recommandent pas de manger des œufs crus ou des cerveaux d'animaux. Alors, quels aliments sont bons pour votre cerveau ? Les scientifiques ont découvert un lien entre l'alimentation et un cerveau sain. Il devient assez clair que les bons aliments peuvent augmenter la puissance du cerveau - vous aider à faire attention, à rester motivé, à améliorer votre mémoire et à _ le stress. Peut-être même prévenir le vieillissement cérébral.

La santé de votre cerveau dépend non seulement de la quantité (ou du peu) de graisse que vous mangez, mais aussi du type de graisse. Les performances intellectuelles nécessitent le type spécifique de graisse que l'on trouve le plus souvent dans certains poissons. Outre le poisson gras, vous devriez introduire de nombreuses feuilles vertes foncées et des fruits colorés dans votre alimentation. La plupart des gens manquent des vitamines spéciales que ces aliments pour le cerveau fournissent.

Mais vous ne réussirez pas bien à votre test simplement parce que vous avez mangé du poisson la veille. Vous devez manger des aliments pour le cerveau régulièrement.

"En route vers le ciel !

Un aventurier, devenu le premier à traverser la Manche en grappe de ballons, a lancé une maison dans les airs, tout comme dans le film à succès ""Là-haut"", en réparation pour un voyage plus ambitieux et un nouveau record.

Le courageux Trappe, originaire de Caroline du Nord, est entré dans la maison à thème cartoon avant de s'envoler au-dessus du Festival International du Ballon de Léon au Mexique il y a plus d'une semaine.

Trappe, âgé de 38 ans, utilisait l'événement comme échauffement pour son vol transatlantique prévu pour l'été prochain. Il ambitionne de parcourir les 2 500 miles en un canot de sauvetage de sept pieds porté par 365 énormes ballons à hélium.

Le brave homme apprend à naviguer en canot de sauvetage, au cas où il aurait besoin de se poser dans l'océan pendant cette aventure périlleuse.

Il volera entre 18 000 pieds et 25 000 pieds, battant son précédent record du monde d'altitude de 21 600 pieds, et devra voler sans interruption sur une distance dix fois plus longue que son précédent record du monde de 230 miles pour réussir.

L'aventurier Trappe, qui détient des records de traversée des Alpes, de vol en grappe de ballons et de distance la plus longue, a consacré toute sa carrière à la préparation de ce projet ambitieux.

""Je ne me suis pas réveillé un jour et j'ai pensé : 'Je vais traverser l'Atlantique'"", a-t-il déclaré. ""Chaque tentative avant celle-ci était préparée pour ce vol. Je m'entraîne depuis longtemps.""

"Vingt ans, c'est long pour se souvenir du nom d'une simple connaissance. J'ai oublié le nom d'une vieille dame, qui était une cliente sur mon parcours de distribution de journaux dans ma ville natale lorsque j'étais un garçon de douze ans. Pourtant, il existe dans ma mémoire qu'elle m'a appris une leçon de pardon que je n'oublierai jamais.

Un après-midi d'hiver, un ami et moi lancions des pierres sur le toit d'une maison pour nous amuser. J'ai été assez courageux pour trouver un gros rocher et l'ai lancé. Malheureusement, le rocher était si lourd qu'il n'a pas volé sur le toit, mais a traversé la fenêtre et s'est retrouvé dans la pièce. Au bruit du verre brisé, nous avons su que nous étions en difficulté et nous nous sommes enfuis.

J'avais tellement peur d'être attrapé que je n'ai pas livré de journaux à la vieille dame pendant quelques jours. La semaine suivante, quand je lui ai de nouveau donné le journal, elle m'a quand même accueilli avec un grand sourire comme d'habitude. Je me suis senti tellement coupable, cependant, que j'ai décidé de mettre de côté mon argent de livraison de journaux pour couvrir le coût de sa fenêtre. Je l'ai fait. Trois semaines plus tard, j'avais économisé sept dollars et je les ai mis dans une enveloppe avec une note expliquant que j'étais désolé d'avoir cassé sa fenêtre et que j'espérais que l'argent pourrait la réparer. J'ai attendu qu'il fasse nuit et j'ai glissé l'enveloppe secrètement dans sa porte.

Le lendemain, j'ai remis le journal à la vieille dame et j'ai pu lui rendre le sourire chaleureux que je recevais d'elle. Elle m'a remercié et m'a donné un sac de délicieux biscuits qu'elle avait faits elle-même.

En prenant les biscuits, j'ai senti une enveloppe et je l'ai sortie du sac. Lorsque j'ai ouvert l'enveloppe, j'ai été surpris. À l'intérieur se trouvaient les sept dollars et une courte note disant ""Je suis fier de toi.""

"Le Palais de l'Élysée en France jouit d'une popularité égale dans le monde à celle du palais de Buckingham au Royaume-Uni, du Kremlin en Russie ainsi que de la Maison-Blanche aux États-Unis. C'est la résidence du président de la République française et le symbole de l'autorité suprême en France.

Le palais de l'Élysée, d'une superficie de 11 000 mètres carrés, se trouve à l'extrémité est des Champs-Élysées dans la ville de Paris proprement dite et est adossé à un grand jardin paisible de plus de vingt mille mètres carrés. Son bâtiment principal, assez beau et gracieux, est une architecture de pierre classique à deux étages de style européen, et à côté se trouvent deux bâtiments latéraux se faisant face et avec une vaste cour rectangulaire au milieu. Il y a au total 369 salles et chambres de différentes tailles.

Le palais de l'Élysée, construit en 1718, a une longue histoire de près de 300 ans à ce jour. Cette maison était d'abord une résidence privée d'un comte nommé d'Evreau, elle était donc appelée Hôtel d'Evreau. Elle avait ensuite subi de nombreux changements et ses propriétaires avaient changé à plusieurs reprises, mais tous les résidents qui y vivaient étaient des personnes distinguées et des hauts fonctionnaires. La maison a été rebaptisée Mansion Bonaparte lorsqu'elle a été détenue par Louis XV et Louis XVI successivement lorsqu'ils ont agi en tant qu'empereurs. Napoléon Ier a signé son acte d'abdication ici lorsqu'il avait subi une défaite à la bataille de Waterloo en 1815. Napoléon III s'installe dans la Mansion en 1848 lorsqu'il est élu président, et la maison devient un palais royal lorsqu'il se déclare empereur. La Troisième République française a publié un décret en 1873, nommant officiellement le palais de l'Élysée comme résidence du président de la République française. Au cours des cent années qui ont suivi, presque tous les présidents de la République française ont travaillé et vécu là-bas. À partir de 1989, le palais de l'Élysée est ouvert au public chaque année en septembre lors de la Journée des châteaux français.

"TOKYO - Le Japon envisage des plans pour apaiser les tensions avec la Chine en reconnaissant les revendications chinoises sur les îles disputées en mer de Chine orientale, tout en maintenant sa propre position, a rapporté l'agence de presse Kyodo mardi, citant des sources.

Le rapport précise que ces plans permettraient au Japon, sans changer sa position de longue date, de faire un petit pas vers la Chine, qui a appelé Tokyo à reconnaître l'existence d'un différend sur les îles Diaoyu, appelées îles Senkaku au Japon.

Le Japon a refusé de revenir sur son récent achat, à la mi-septembre, de trois des cinq îles Diaoyu à un soi-disant propriétaire japonais privé, ce que le gouvernement dit avoir fait pour maintenir les îles inhabitées de manière stable, malgré les vives protestations de la Chine.

Toutefois, il reste incertain si la Chine serait encouragée par cette initiative japonaise à améliorer les relations tendues, précise Kyodo.

"Jess était vraiment très heureux. En arrivant à sa place en classe ce matin-là, il trouva une invitation sur son bureau. Elle provenait de quelques-uns de ses camarades de classe qui l'invitaient à se joindre à leur voyage de camping. C'était la première fois qu'on lui demandait de participer à une activité extrascolaire. Pourquoi le sollicitaient-ils maintenant ? Personne ne semblait l'aimer. En fait, il s'était senti tellement seul qu'il mangeait beaucoup pour se sentir moins seul. Résultat, il avait pris beaucoup de poids, ce qui donnait aux enfants encore plus de raisons de se moquer de lui.

Cindy, qui se tenait près de Jess lorsqu'il lut l'invitation, sortit rapidement pour dire aux autres que la blague avait marché. Tout le monde était content que Jess croie à cette histoire. Mais il n'y avait pas de voyage de camping. Tout était inventé.

Au début, Cindy trouva ça amusant. Mais plus tard, lorsque Jess lui dit qu'il allait acheter un sac de couchage avec son argent de poche, Cindy eut un second avis. Elle savait que la famille de Jess avait peu d'argent, et elle détestait le voir dépenser son argent de poche pour quelque chose qu'il n'utiliserait jamais.

"  Une enquête a révélé que 80% des étudiants diplômés de la province du Zhejiang, dans l'est de la Chine, ont déclaré qu'ils abandonneraient leurs efforts pour trouver un emploi à Pékin, Shanghai et Guangzhou, les villes de premier rang en Chine qui ont été considérées comme des lieux de rêve pour beaucoup, en raison des prix de l'immobilier inaccessibles et du coût de la vie élevé.
Le Yangtse Evening Post a mené l'enquête auprès de 50 demandeurs d'emploi qui assistaient à la foire de l'emploi du dimanche à Jiangsu pour les étudiants diplômés. L'enquête a montré que les diplômés deviennent plus réalistes dans leur recherche d'emploi malgré l'amélioration du marché du travail.

Il y a Wellman, dont les jambes ont été gravement blessées il y a neuf ans lors d'un accident d'escalade, et Corbett, un grimpeur expérimenté. Ensemble, ils ont escaladé Half Dome, le célèbre rocher de 2 000 pieds du parc national de Yosemite, en empruntant l'un des itinéraires les plus difficiles.

Pendant l'ascension, Corbett prenait les devants, enfonçant les crampons métalliques qui guidaient les cordes et grimpait. Puis, après que Wellman se soit hissé sur la corde, Corbett descendait pour enlever les crampons et grimpait à nouveau. Ce processus a été répété encore et encore, centimètre par centimètre, pendant 13 jours. Le travail de Wellman n'était pas facile non plus. Il se hissa sur la corde grâce à la seule force de ses bras. Au total, Wellman a estimé qu'il avait effectué 5 000 tractions sur la corde pendant l'ascension.

Cependant, lorsque les deux hommes se sont rencontrés pour la première fois, ils n'ont jamais parlé d'escalade. ""Il savait que c'est comme ça que j'ai été blessé"", a déclaré Wellman. Jusqu'à ce qu'un jour Wellman décide qu'il voulait grimper à nouveau et qu'ils commencent à s'entraîner.

Leur ascension de Half Dome n'a pas été sans encombre. À un moment donné, des morceaux de roche se sont détachés, et Corbett a chuté rapidement. Wellman a bloqué leur corde en place, stoppant sa chute à 20 pieds. Sa réaction rapide a probablement sauvé la vie de son ami.

"Il existe de nombreuses façons d'apprendre une langue, chacune ayant ses avantages et ses inconvénients. Vous constaterez peut-être qu'une combinaison de celles-ci est la meilleure option pour vous.

Si vous trouvez un cours dans la langue que vous souhaitez apprendre dans votre pays, c'est une très bonne façon d'étudier. Une variété de cours sont généralement disponibles, y compris des cours à temps partiel et à temps plein. Si vous regardez autour de vous, vous pouvez probablement trouver un cours qui correspond à vos besoins.

Le principal avantage de ces cours est que vous aurez un professeur pour vous donner des instructions, vous soutenir et avec qui pratiquer votre langue. Vous étudierez également avec d'autres personnes qui sont plus ou moins au même niveau et vous pourrez échanger des idées avec eux et vous aider mutuellement.

Une option consiste à étudier une langue dans un pays où elle est parlée. Il existe de nombreuses écoles qui enseignent l'anglais, le français, l'espagnol, l'italien et l'allemand, mais beaucoup moins qui enseignent d'autres langues. Le principal avantage d'étudier à l'étranger est que vous êtes totalement immergé dans la langue, non seulement en classe, mais aussi le reste du temps. En conséquence, vous pouvez progresser rapidement.

Le principal inconvénient d'étudier à l'étranger est le coût, non seulement de votre cours, mais aussi de votre nourriture et de vos déplacements. Cependant, si vous êtes un locuteur natif d'anglais, vous pourriez obtenir un emploi d'enseignant d'anglais dans un pays où la langue que vous souhaitez apprendre est parlée.

Étudier en ligne est également un bon choix. Il existe de nombreuses options pour de nombreuses langues. Beaucoup sont gratuites, mais certaines sont payantes.

"Alors que Daniel et moi marchons sur le sentier, la nuit commence à tomber. ""J'aurais peur d'être dehors à cette heure-ci à Londres"", dit-il. ""J'aurais peur de me faire attaquer."" Je passe la journée avec Daniel, 16 ans, et six autres élèves de Burlington Danes School dans une ferme à Bath. La plupart d'entre eux n'ont jamais été à la campagne et ont passé la semaine dernière à nourrir les vaches et à faire de longues promenades hivernales.

Ils sont ici à Jamie's Farm. Fondée par Feilden, elle vise à offrir aux enfants des quartiers défavorisés l'expérience de la vie rurale. Les enfants, dont beaucoup ont été dans des gangs ou ont eu des problèmes avec la police, restent une semaine dans la maison familiale des Feilden. Selon Feilden, aucun objet n'a été perdu, volé ou cassé dans la ferme. Comme le dit sa mère, ""Je pense que la beauté ici les aide."" Ou comme le dit Daniel, 16 ans, ""J'aime être ici. Ça sent tellement bon.""

Les élèves se lèvent tôt pour nourrir les vaches, les cochons, les poules et les chevaux, avant de prendre un petit déjeuner cuisiné. S'ensuit ensuite d'autres travaux à la ferme, le déjeuner, plus de travail, une longue promenade, le dîner et enfin le coucher. Ils adorent ça. ""C'est génial de ne pas avoir de téléphone"", explique l'un d'eux. ""Je me concentre beaucoup mieux."" Beaucoup parlent de la façon dont le régime alimentaire a changé leur humeur et d'autres de combien ils aiment nourrir les animaux.

L'idée de la ferme est née alors que Feilden travaillait comme professeur dans un collège ""difficile"" de Croydon. La plupart des élèves n'avaient jamais été au-delà de la ville, et encore moins à la campagne. Feilden estimait que l'agriculture pouvait aider. ""Cela donnait aux élèves quelque chose à faire à part se battre."" Il ne s'agit évidemment pas d'une _ -- un enfant en difficulté restera un enfant en difficulté -- mais Feilden dit que cela en vaut toujours la peine.

"Imaginez être chauve et entrer en classe à l'école. Vous vous échappez au dernier rang, mais vous voyez d'autres élèves vous montrer du doigt et parler de vous. Vous vous sentez embarrassé. Après l'école, vous courez à la maison pour éviter de parler à qui que ce soit.
Certains problèmes médicaux provoquent la perte de cheveux. Cela peut être embarrassant pour les adultes, mais pour les enfants, c'est encore pire. Ils se sentent souvent mal dans leur peau, et les autres enfants se moquent d'eux.
Dans la vingtaine, Madonna Coffman a développé l'alopécie, une maladie de peau qui provoque la perte de cheveux. Elle s'est rétablie après quelques années, mais 15 ans plus tard, sa fille de 4 ans a développé l'alopécie. Les sentiments de sa fille ont encouragé Coffman à créer Locks of Love, une organisation à but non lucratif.
Locks of Love fournit des perruques aux enfants qui perdent leurs cheveux pour des raisons médicales. Les enfants de familles pauvres reçoivent des perruques gratuitement ou à des prix que leurs familles peuvent se permettre. L'organisation espère accroître la confiance des enfants et les aider à vivre une vie plus normale.
Les perruques sont fabriquées à partir de cheveux donnés par des gens ordinaires. Ils font pousser leurs cheveux longs, les coupent à au moins 10 pouces et les envoient par courrier à Locks of Love. Locks of Love envoie ensuite les cheveux à l'entreprise qui fabrique les perruques. L'organisation affirme que 80 % de ceux qui donnent leurs cheveux sont des enfants qui veulent aider d'autres enfants.
Les perruques sont faciles à porter et s'adaptent parfaitement à la tête du porteur. Personne, à part les enfants qui portent les perruques, ne peut les retirer. Cela permet aux enfants de courir, de jouer et de nager sans se soucier que la perruque ne tombe. Et les autres enfants ne pourront pas non plus retirer la perruque.
Ces perruques font plus que changer l'apparence des enfants. Elles aident les enfants à profiter de leur enfance. Les enfants peuvent participer à des activités, se faire des amis et affronter chaque jour avec confiance. Locks of Love permet aux enfants d'être à nouveau des enfants.

"Un homme s'est arrêté avec sa voiture devant la porte d'une boutique de fleurs. Il avait prévu de commander des fleurs et de les faire livrer à sa mère, qui vivait loin dans sa ville natale. Alors qu'il allait entrer dans la boutique, il a vu une petite fille pleurer sur la route. L'homme lui a demandé : ""Pourquoi pleures-tu ?""

""Je veux acheter une rose pour ma mère, mais je n'ai pas assez d'argent"", a répondu la fille.

L'homme a pris la main de la fille et est entré dans la boutique de fleurs. Il a d'abord commandé le bouquet pour sa mère et a acheté une rose pour la fille.

En sortant de la boutique, l'homme a demandé à la fille si elle voulait qu'il la ramène chez elle.

""Tu vas vraiment me ramener chez moi ?"" a demandé la fille.

""Bien sûr"", a répondu l'homme.

""Alors amène-moi chez ma mère. Mais l'endroit où ma mère habite est très loin.""

L'homme a roulé le long de la route de montagne et est finalement arrivé au cimetière.

La petite fille a déposé la fleur sur une tombe fraîche. Pour offrir une rose à sa mère qui était décédée un mois auparavant, elle avait fait un très long voyage.

L'homme a conduit la fille chez elle puis est retourné à la boutique de fleurs. Il a annulé le bouquet et a acheté une grande botte de fleurs fraîches à la place. Il s'est rendu directement chez sa mère, à cinq heures de route de là. Il allait lui offrir les fleurs en personne.

"Le vélo n'est pas toujours facile. Les rues animées, le manque de pistes cyclables et de zones de stationnement peuvent en faire une bataille. Mais même ces difficultés ne peuvent arrêter l'amour des Européens pour le vélo. Selon Reuters, plus de vélos que de voitures ont été vendus dans 26 des 28 États de l'Union européenne cette année.

Dans certains pays européens, les gens aiment vraiment les vélos. ""Les gens vont au travail à vélo et emmènent leur vélo à l'épicerie"", a déclaré Bill Strickland, rédacteur en chef du magazine Bicycling, au journaliste de Reuters.

Alors, qu'est-ce qui a mené à la popularité croissante du vélo en Europe ? Le vélo est ""un moyen de transport sûr, propre, sain et peu coûteux pour se déplacer en ville"", a conclu le Daily Star. ""Non seulement il réduit les problèmes de circulation et la pollution, mais il contribue également à la santé publique.""

Des règles favorables au vélo ont également été mises en place. Des dizaines de villes ont rejoint une initiative de l'Union européenne pour faire du vélo une forme de transport urbain, comme les voitures. Un certain nombre de villes comme Stockholm, Londres, Florence et Munich proposent désormais des pistes cyclables spéciales. Copenhague va encore plus loin en séparant au maximum les vélos et les voitures. Sur ces voies, les feux de circulation sont conçus au rythme des vélos, et non des voitures. Pour les personnes vivant loin des centres-villes, se rendre au travail à vélo seul peut prendre trop de temps. C'est pourquoi de nombreux pays européens autorisent désormais les cyclistes à emmener leur vélo dans les trains de métro. Les Européens sont également créatifs pour résoudre les problèmes de stationnement. Amsterdam a mis au point une solution high-tech : vous verrouillez votre vélo sur un support qui s'enfonce ensuite sous terre. Lorsque vous voulez récupérer votre vélo, il est remonté à la surface.

"Les oiseaux peuvent ""lire"" le regard humain

Nous savons tous que les gens changent parfois de comportement lorsqu'une personne les regarde. Maintenant, une nouvelle étude publiée en ligne le 2 avril dans Current Biology montre que les choucas, des oiseaux apparentés aux corbeaux avec des yeux qui ressemblent à des yeux humains, peuvent faire de même.

""Les choucas semblent reconnaître le rôle de l'œil dans la perception visuelle, ou du moins ils sont extrêmement sensibles à l'orientation des yeux humains"", a déclaré Auguste von Bayern, anciennement de l'Université de Cambridge et maintenant à l'Université d'Oxford.

Lorsqu'ils se sont vu présenter une nourriture préférée, des choucas élevés à la main ont mis beaucoup plus de temps à obtenir la récompense lorsqu'une personne dirigeait ses yeux vers la nourriture que lorsqu'elle regardait ailleurs, selon l'équipe de recherche dirigée par Nathan Emery de l'Université de Cambridge et de la Queen Mary University de Londres. Les oiseaux n'ont hésité que lorsque la personne était inconnue et donc potentiellement menaçante.

De plus, les oiseaux ont été capables d'interpréter les gestes communicatifs humains, tels que l'alternance du regard et le pointage, pour les aider à trouver de la nourriture cachée, ont-ils constaté. Les oiseaux n'ont pas réussi à utiliser des indices immobiles, notamment le regard ou l'orientation de la tête.

Contrairement à la plupart des oiseaux, les yeux des choucas ont une pupille sombre entourée d'un iris blanc argenté. Les chercheurs ont déclaré qu'ils pensaient que les choucas sont probablement sensibles aux yeux humains car, comme chez les humains, les yeux sont un moyen de communication important pour eux. Les oiseaux élevés à la main examinés dans l'étude sont peut-être encore meilleurs que les choucas sauvages pour prêter attention au regard humain et répondre aux gestes des personnes qui les ont élevés.

Les résultats sont particulièrement remarquables étant donné que la plupart des autres espèces étudiées jusqu'à présent, y compris notre plus proche parent, le chimpanzé, et ""le meilleur ami de l'homme"", le chien, ne sont pas particulièrement sensibles à l'orientation des yeux et au regard, a déclaré von Bayern. Au lieu de cela, a-t-elle poursuivi, les chimpanzés et les chiens semblent se fier à d'autres indices tels que l'orientation de la tête ou du corps pour déterminer la direction du regard des autres. Les résultats suggèrent que les oiseaux méritent peut-être plus de respect pour leurs capacités mentales.

""Nous avons peut-être sous-estimé le monde psychologique des oiseaux"", a déclaré von Bayern. ""Les choucas, parmi de nombreux autres oiseaux, forment des liens de couple à vie et doivent avoir beaucoup de points communs et travailler ensemble avec leur partenaire, ce qui nécessite un moyen efficace de communiquer et une sensibilité au point de vue de leur partenaire.""

"Oubliez les cyclistes, les piétons sont le vrai danger

Nous débattons de ce sujet. Voici quelques lettres de nos lecteurs.

# Oui, de nombreux cyclistes se comportent dangereusement. De nombreux conducteurs manquent de respect aux cyclistes. Mais les piétons sont probablement les pires contrevenants.
Les gens de tous âges marchent joyeusement sur le trottoir les yeux et les mains collés à leur téléphone portable, sans se rendre compte de ce qui se passe autour d'eux. Ils peuvent même faire de même lorsqu'ils traversent une route à un passage piétonnier ou ailleurs. Le reste d'entre nous doit les éviter ou rester immobile pour attendre l'inévitable collision.
Le vrai problème, c'est que certains piétons semblent être, du moins pour le moment, dans des mondes qui leur sont propres et qui, pour eux, sont bien plus importants que le bien-être des autres.
----Michael Horan

# J'ai adoré la lettre de Bob Brooks sur les cyclistes (Points de vue, 29 mai). J'ai peur qu'ils semblent penser qu'ils sont propriétaires des routes.
Je traversais Altrincham Road un matin lorsqu'un cycliste m'a doublé et, lorsqu'on lui a demandé ce qu'il faisait, il m'a crié dessus.
Le gouvernement a construit une piste cyclable sur la route mais elle est rarement utilisée.
La police ne fait rien. Quelle blague !
Tous les cyclistes devraient être obligés d'utiliser les pistes cyclables et de porter un casque, des vestes fluorescentes et des lumières la nuit et le matin. Ils devraient payer une sorte de taxe et être amendés pour ne pas les porter.
----Carol Harvey

# Les cyclistes montent et descendent des trottoirs (qui sont destinés aux piétons), roulent à vive allure sur les trottoirs et pensent avoir un droit particulier de passer les feux rouges lorsqu'ils sont au rouge.
J'ai failli être renversé récemment par un cycliste qui circulait sur le trottoir alors qu'il y avait une piste cyclable juste à côté de lui.
Les autres usagers de la route, y compris les cavaliers, parviennent à respecter les règles, alors pourquoi pas les cyclistes ?
Il est temps qu'ils soient obligés de s'enregistrer et de s'assurer, afin que lorsqu'ils heurtent un piéton ou un véhicule, ou provoquent un accident, au moins ils puissent être soignés et qu'il y ait une possibilité de réclamer des dommages.

"La GRANDE-BRETAGNE est une destination touristique populaire. Mais les visites du pays présentent des avantages et des inconvénients.

**Bonne nouvelle**

Musées gratuits : Aucun frais d'entrée pour des collections exceptionnelles d'art et d'antiquités.

Musique pop : La Grande-Bretagne est le seul pays à rivaliser (......) avec les États-Unis sur ce point.

Taxis noirs : Les chauffeurs de taxi londoniens savent où ils vont, même s'il n'y en a jamais assez le week-end ou la nuit.

Choix de la nourriture : Les visiteurs peuvent trouver de tout, des restaurants éthiopiens aux restaurants suédois.

Mode : Non seulement les accros de la mode aiment profondément et respectent les grandes marques comme Vivienne Westwood, Alexander McQueen ; les styles de rue sont également justement appréciés.

**Mauvaise nouvelle**

Mauvais service : « Cela fait partie de l'image du lieu. Les gens peuvent se moquer de l'impolitesse qu'ils ont subie », déclare le professeur Tony Seaton du Centre de recherche international sur le tourisme de l'université de Luton.

Mauvais transports en commun : Les trains et les bus sont censés décourager les touristes les plus enthousiastes, bien que le métro londonien surpeuplé soit inexplicablement populaire.

Manque de langue : Parler lentement et clairement ne permettra pas à de nombreux visiteurs étrangers d'aller très loin, même dans les pièges à touristes.

Pluie : Toujours dans le top des plaintes.

Absence de climatisation : De sorte que même les étés exceptionnellement chauds deviennent aussi insupportables que les averses.

Hôtels trop chers : Le seul pays européen avec un taux de taxe plus élevé sur les chambres d'hôtel est le Danemark.

"Les téléphones portables sont les nouvelles cigarettes

Lorsque vous montez dans un bus, vous le prenez. Lorsque vous êtes au travail, vous faites une pause pour passer un moment seul avec lui. Lorsque vous attendez le dîner, vous jouez avec lui. 
Cigarette ? Non, c'est une autre chose très addictive au début du 21e siècle, le téléphone portable. Les experts affirment qu'il devient de plus en plus difficile pour de nombreuses personnes de freiner leur envie de le serrer plus fort que la plupart de leurs relations personnelles. 
Avec sa surface charmante et son toucher satisfaisant, le téléphone portable nous connecte même si nous ne sommes qu'à un mètre de distance. Au cours des dernières années seulement, le téléphone portable a mis au défi les individus, les employeurs, les fabricants de téléphones et les conseillers d'une manière que ses inventeurs à la fin des années 1940 n'auraient jamais imaginée. 
Les coûts deviennent encore plus évidents, et je ne parle pas seulement de la facture mensuelle. Le Dr Chris Knippers, conseiller au Betty Ford Center en Californie du Sud, rapporte que la surutilisation des téléphones portables a créé un problème social : une barrière au contact personnel en tête-à-tête. 
Cela peut sembler extrême. Mais nous avons tous été témoins de la preuve : la personne au restaurant qui parle au téléphone pendant tout le repas, ignorant ses enfants autour de la table ; la femme qui parle au téléphone tout le temps, ignorant son mari ; l'adolescent qui envoie des textos tout le chemin de l'école à la maison, évitant tout contact avec les autres enfants autour de lui. 
Comment cela améliore-t-il la qualité de notre vie ? Jim Williams, sociologue industriel basé dans le Massachusetts, note que la dépendance au téléphone portable est un symptôme d'un fossé croissant de séparation personnelle. L'étude menée en 2014 note qu'un quart des Américains disent n'avoir personne à qui parler de leurs affaires personnelles les plus importantes. Malgré l'utilisation croissante des téléphones, des courriels et de la messagerie instantanée, nous, les jeunes, n'avons pas autant d'amis que nos parents. ""Tout comme plus d'informations ont conduit à moins de sagesse, plus de connaissances via Internet et les téléphones portables ont produit moins d'amis"", dit-il.

"Le smog est un problème majeur dans de nombreuses villes chinoises. Mais il semble que, mis à part le port d'un masque, peu d'entre nous savent ce qui a causé le smog et ce qu'il faut faire pour le combattre. Chai Jing, une ancienne intervieweuse de l'actualité à CCTV, a abordé ces questions dans son documentaire Sous le Dôme.

Le film de 103 minutes a été mis en ligne le 28 février. Dans le film, Chai visite des lieux pollués et s'entretient avec des fonctionnaires et des scientifiques. Elle estime que la combustion excessive de charbon et de pétrole est la principale cause des PM2.5 et du smog.

Pour résoudre le problème, Chai suggère que nous devrions nettoyer notre charbon et notre pétrole ou les remplacer par des énergies plus propres comme le gaz naturel.

Dans son film, Chai souligne également que chacun peut faire quelque chose pour aider à contrôler le smog. Par exemple, nous pouvons vivre une vie plus verte en utilisant davantage les transports en commun. Ou si nous voyons des choses qui pourraient nuire à l'environnement, nous pouvons essayer de les arrêter. Dans le film, lorsqu'elle voit un restaurant cuisiner sans installations de filtration adéquates, elle appelle la ligne d'assistance 12369. Le restaurant a installé le filtre une semaine plus tard.

Elle a également collaboré avec une organisation américaine pour collecter des fonds pour les enfants atteints de maladies cardiaques.

Née en 1942 dans la province du Guangdong, Liang a déménagé avec sa famille à Taïwan à l'âge de sept ans. Liang a enseigné dans une école primaire pendant sept ans jusqu'à ce que son petit ami parte pour l'Amérique en 1969, un an après leur mariage.

"Avez-vous déjà été pris dans un embouteillage juste après que l'animateur radio ait annoncé que la route était dégagée ? Ou vous êtes-vous préparé à la congestion dont il a parlé, seulement pour vous retrouver à rouler sans encombre ?
     Un grand nombre de sociétés privées affirment avoir la solution à ces frustrations : une meilleure information.
     Aujourd'hui, l'une de ces sociétés, SpeedInfo Inc., a installé 50 capteurs radar sans fil alimentés par l'énergie solaire le long des principales voies duprefix = st1 /District de Columbiaqui prennent des mesures de la vitesse moyenne du trafic toutes les deux minutes dans les deux sens.
     La société affirme que les capteurs fournissent une image beaucoup plus précise des conditions routières que celle qui peut être collectée à partir d'hélicoptères ou d'alertes de la police de la route.
     Dans un modèle économique que SpeedInfo espère développer dans tout le pays, la société basée à San José, en Californie, permet à la ville d'utiliser les données gratuitement pour la planification du trafic, en échange d'un accès au bord de la route. SpeedInfo prévoit de vendre les informations à des clients payants, notamment les diffuseurs et les entreprises qui fournissent des informations pour les équipements de navigation embarquée.
Le problème avec les rapports de trafic traditionnels est que, dans la plupart des régions du pays, ils reposent sur les rapports d'accidents de la police de la route qui arrivent avec 30 à 40 minutes de retard et sur quelques hélicoptères qui prennent leur envol pendant les heures de pointe, a déclaré Doug Finlay, directeur général de SpeedInfo.
      ""Chopper Bill prend son envol et dit : 'Oh, je regarde la route et les voitures vont lentement', "" a déclaré Finlay. ""Chopper Bill est la meilleure donnée que vous ayez.""
     Tim Lomax, chercheur au Texas Transportation Institute, a déclaré qu'une récente augmentation des systèmes de données de trafic de haute technologie est bonne pour les conducteurs.

"Disons que vous avez suivi des cours de violon pendant toute votre scolarité élémentaire, mais que vous n'avez pas sorti l'instrument de son étui depuis des années. Est-ce que tous ces cours ont été un gaspillage d'argent de la part de vos parents parce que vous n'êtes pas devenu violoniste ?

Même si cela fait longtemps que vous n'avez pas joué du violon, une nouvelle étude montre qu'une seule année de formation musicale peut avoir un impact positif sur votre cerveau qui durera toute votre vie.

Dans une expérience, des chercheurs ont comparé des enfants qui avaient suivi des cours de musique à ceux qui n'en avaient pas suivi. Laurel Trainor, qui étudie la musique et l'esprit, a découvert que les enfants ayant reçu une formation musicale présentaient de meilleures réponses cérébrales lors de certains examens de reconnaissance sonore. Les conclusions de Trainor montrent la possibilité que l'éducation musicale puisse réellement améliorer le cortex auditif du cerveau. ""Les résultats de l'étude montrent que la formation musicale affecte l'attention et la mémoire, et aide les enfants à développer des compétences d'apprentissage. De cette façon, la formation musicale pourrait conduire à un meilleur apprentissage dans un certain nombre de domaines"", a déclaré Trainor dans un communiqué. Les effets de l'éducation musicale sont encore plus évidents chez les enfants ayant des difficultés de lecture et d'écriture et d'autres handicaps liés au langage.

Donc, que vous puissiez jouer une bonne pièce de musique ou non, il est probable que vos années de cours de musique ont préparé votre cerveau à tous les discours, courriels et conversations d'adultes qui font partie de votre vie aujourd'hui. Nous devrions nous assurer que les enfants d'aujourd'hui ont les mêmes opportunités de faire de la musique, et aider en faisant du bénévolat ou en faisant don d'instruments au département d'éducation musicale de votre école.

"Un petit vieux couple entra lentement dans un McDonald's un soir d'hiver glacial. Ils étaient tellement âgés qu'ils semblaient déplacés au milieu des jeunes familles et des jeunes couples qui mangeaient là ce soir-là. 

Certains clients les regardaient avec admiration. On pouvait deviner ce que les admirateurs pensaient. ""Regardez, voici un couple qui a traversé beaucoup de choses ensemble, probablement pendant 60 ans ou plus !""

Le petit vieux s'approcha du comptoir, passa sa commande sans hésitation et paya ensuite leur repas. Le couple prit une table près du mur du fond et commença à retirer la nourriture du plateau. Il y avait un hamburger, une portion de frites et une boisson. Le petit vieux déballa le hamburger simple et le coupa soigneusement en deux. Il plaça une moitié devant sa femme. Puis il compta soigneusement les frites, les divisa en deux tas et plaça soigneusement un tas devant sa femme. Il prit une gorgée de la boisson, sa femme en prit une aussi et posa ensuite le gobelet entre eux.

Puis la foule remarqua que la petite vieille n'avait pas mangé une seule bouchée. Elle était simplement assise là à regarder son mari manger et prenait parfois des tours de gorgées de la boisson.

Les scientifiques et les historiens recherchent depuis longtemps des indices pour expliquer qui a traversé quels océans en premier. Lorsqu'il s'agit du voyage entre la Polynésie et l'Amérique du Sud, les poulets ont peut-être été parmi les premiers voyageurs océaniques, selon de nouvelles preuves.

Après avoir étudié un os de poulet antique, des anthropologues de l'Université d'Auckland en Nouvelle-Zélande affirment maintenant que les gens et les poulets ont voyagé de la Polynésie vers ce qui est aujourd'hui le Chili il y a environ 620 ans. À cette époque, le peuple Inca vivait déjà en Amérique du Sud, mais les Polynésiens auraient été les premiers à y arriver par mer. Les théories précédentes affirmaient que les explorateurs européens et leurs poulets avaient navigué vers l'Amérique du Sud en premier - mais ces voyageurs ne sont arrivés qu'un siècle plus tard.

En 2002, des archéologues ont déterré 50 os de poulet sur un site au Chili appelé El Arenal. L'équipe néo-zélandaise a analysé l'un de ces os. Selon leurs calculs, l'os a environ 650 ans.

Les chercheurs ont également comparé le matériel génétique, ou ADN, de l'os de poulet sud-américain avec l'ADN de 11 os de poulet qui avaient été trouvés sur les îles polynésiennes de Tonga et d'Samoa américaines. Ces îles se trouvent à 6 000 miles à l'ouest du Chili. Les os trouvés sur les îles polynésiennes ont entre 600 et 2 000 ans.

Les résultats des comparaisons ont montré que les os de poulet des sites polynésien et sud-américain avaient une partie d'ADN en commun. Les chercheurs ont trouvé la même partie d'ADN dans les plumes de deux poulets vivants au Chili qui appartiennent à une race moderne qui pond des œufs bleus. Cette preuve ADN suggère une étroite relation entre les poulets.

""Cependant, le poids des preuves scientifiques est désormais derrière l'hypothèse selon laquelle ce sont les Polynésiens navigateurs qui ont navigué des îles vers l'Amérique du Sud et sont retournés"", déclare l'archéologue Patrick V. Kirch de l'Université de Californie à Berkeley.

"Une étude récente a révélé que les Français sont les deuxièmes Européens les plus incertains de leur niveau d'anglais, après les Italiens. Seuls 13 % des Français interrogés se sont déclarés compétents dans la langue, selon l'agence de données européennes Eurostat.

La situation n'est pas meilleure dans le monde des affaires, où les trois quarts des dirigeants français se sentent mal préparés à passer un entretien en anglais et seulement 16 % déclarent se sentir à l'aise avec la langue, selon une autre étude.

Les résultats de l'enquête ne sont pas surprenants. Les Français ont toujours semblé avoir une attitude froide et pessimiste envers la langue anglaise. Mais ce qui m'a frappé, c'est que, malgré le pessimisme français, vivre à Paris sans parler la langue de Molière est plus facile aujourd'hui qu'autrefois.

Les nouveaux immigrants en sont en partie la raison. Je peux facilement discuter avec le propriétaire de la laverie de mon quartier. Acheter les médicaments dont j'ai besoin à la pharmacie locale est un jeu d'enfant. Commander un repas en anglais au restaurant situé à deux pâtés de maisons de mon appartement ne me met pas mal à l'aise. Tout cela parce que les personnes qui gèrent ces commerces sont des immigrants.

Une plus grande tolérance et acceptation des non-francophones reflète le fait que la France, volontairement ou non, a commencé à embrasser la mondialisation avec plus de confort. Par exemple, vous ne recevrez plus le même regard que vous auriez eu il y a 15 ans si vous demandez votre chemin en anglais dans les rues de Paris.

J'ai également rencontré de nombreux Français de souche qui sont heureux de communiquer en anglais. Ce sont généralement des gens ouverts d'esprit et sensibles aux changements au-delà de leurs propres territoires. Ils sont très intéressés à comprendre ce qui se passe de l'autre côté du globe.

Dans ma ville natale, l'anglais fait également l'objet de débats houleux depuis que les autorités de l'éducation de Beijing ont décidé de réduire l'importance de la maîtrise de l'anglais aux examens d'entrée à l'université et d'augmenter celle de la langue et de la littérature chinoises. Les Chinois et les Français partagent des similitudes dans leurs attitudes envers les langues étrangères. Nous sommes tous deux si fiers de nos propres langues et cultures que nous pouvons nous sentir mal à l'aise lorsque nous sommes obligés de communiquer dans une autre langue.

Mais que cela nous plaise ou non, l'anglais reste la langue la plus utilisée au monde, du moins dans un avenir prévisible. Après tout, il ne s'agit pas d'abandonner sa propre langue, mais d'être en mesure de s'intégrer plus facilement dans ce monde mondialisé.

"Les anniversaires sont souvent synonymes de surprises. Mais la surprise de cette année pour l'anniversaire du grand dramaturge britannique William Shakespeare est sans aucun doute l'une des plus dramatiques.
Le 22 avril, un jour avant son 441e anniversaire, des experts ont découvert qu'un des portraits les plus reconnaissables de William Shakespeare est un faux. Cela signifie que nous n'avons plus une bonne idée de ce à quoi Shakespeare ressemblait. ""Il est fort possible que de nombreuses images de Shakespeare puissent être peu fiables car beaucoup d'entre elles sont des copies de celle-ci"", a déclaré un expert de la National Portrait Gallery de Grande-Bretagne.
Cette découverte intervient après quatre mois de tests utilisant des rayons X, des ultraviolets, la microphotographie et des échantillons de peinture. Les experts de la galerie disent que l'image - communément appelée le ""portrait à la fleur"" - a en fait été peinte dans les années 1800, environ deux siècles après la mort de Shakespeare. Les experts en art qui travaillent à la galerie affirment avoir également utilisé la technologie chimique moderne pour vérifier la peinture sur l'image. Ces vérifications ont révélé des traces de peinture datant d'environ 1814. Shakespeare est mort en 1616, et la date qui apparaît sur le portrait est 1609.
""Nous pensons maintenant que le portrait date d'environ 1818 à 1840. C'est à cette époque qu'il y a eu un regain d'intérêt pour les pièces de Shakespeare"", a déclaré Tarnya Cooper, conservatrice de la galerie, à l'Associated President.
La fausse image a souvent été utilisée comme couverture pour les collections de ses pièces. Elle est appelée le portrait à la fleur parce que l'un de ses propriétaires, Desmond Flower, l'a donnée à la Royal Shakespeare Company.
""Il y a toujours eu des questions sur le tableau"", a déclaré David Howells, conservateur de la Royal Shakespeare Company. ""Maintenant que nous connaissons la vérité, nous pouvons placer l'image à sa juste place dans l'histoire de la portraiture shakespearienne.""
Deux autres images de Shakespeare sont également étudiées dans le cadre de l'enquête, et les résultats seront annoncés plus tard ce mois-ci.

"Les gens suivent un régime pour paraître plus attirants. Les poissons suivent un régime pour éviter d'être battus, chassés de leur groupe social et mangés en conséquence. C'est la conclusion fascinante des dernières recherches sur le comportement des poissons menées par une équipe de scientifiques australiens.
L'équipe de recherche a découvert que les poissons subordonnés suivent volontairement un régime pour éviter de défier leurs plus grands compétiteurs. ""En étudiant les gobies, nous avons remarqué que seuls les deux plus grands individus, un mâle et une femelle, avaient des droits de reproduction au sein du groupe"", explique Marian Wong. ""Tous les autres membres du groupe sont des femelles non reproductrices, chacune étant 5 à 10 % plus petite que sa plus grande compétitrice. Nous voulions découvrir comment elles maintiennent cette séparation de taille précise.""
La raison de cette différence de taille était facile à voir. Une fois qu'un poisson subordonné atteint une taille à 5-10% près de celle de son plus grand compétiteur, il provoque une bagarre qui se termine généralement par l'expulsion du petit gobie du groupe. Le plus souvent, * il est ensuite dévoré.
Il semblait que les plus petits poissons se maintenaient petits afin d'éviter de défier le poisson dominant. On ne savait pas s'ils le faisaient volontairement, en se retenant de manger, ou non. L'équipe de recherche a décidé de faire une expérience. Ils ont tenté d'engraisser certains des gobies subordonnés pour voir ce qui se passait. À leur grande surprise, les gobies ont simplement refusé la nourriture supplémentaire qui leur était offerte, préférant clairement rester petits et éviter les combats plutôt que de se faire un festin.
Cette découverte remet en question la vision scientifique traditionnelle de la manière dont les individus dominants maintiennent leur position dans un groupe. Auparavant, on pensait que les grands individus utilisaient simplement leur poids et leur taille pour menacer leurs subordonnés et prendre plus de nourriture pour eux-mêmes, gardant ainsi leurs compétiteurs petits.
Si les habitudes des gobies peuvent paraître un peu mystérieuses, le Dr Wong explique que comprendre les relations entre les animaux dominants et subordonnés est important pour comprendre comment les sociétés hiérarchiques restent stables.
La recherche a prouvé que le régime volontaire est une habitude loin d'être exclusive aux humains. ""Nous n'avons pas encore une compréhension complète de la généralisation de la réduction volontaire de l'apport alimentaire dans la nature"", commentent les chercheurs. ""Les données sur le régime alimentaire humain suggèrent que, si les humains suivent généralement un régime pour améliorer leur santé ou augmenter leur attractivité, cela améliore rarement la santé à long terme et les hommes préfèrent régulièrement les femmes qui sont plus grosses que l'idéal des femmes elles-mêmes.""

1. Mémoriser les numéros de téléphone
Il était ennuyeux de se souvenir des numéros. Maintenant, nous les ajoutons simplement à notre liste de contacts. Cela fonctionne généralement bien, sauf si notre appareil est perdu, volé ou endommagé. On ne peut pas s'attendre à ce que tout le monde se souvienne de tous ses numéros de contact. Ce que nous pouvons faire, c'est mémoriser 5 de nos numéros de contact les plus importants. Cela devrait inclure un mélange de famille, d'amis et d'affaires. Si vous êtes vraiment ambitieux, vous pouvez mémoriser 5 contacts pour chaque catégorie.

2. Compétences en lecture de cartes
La commodité et l'efficacité des systèmes de guidage GPS et des cartes numériques générées par les moteurs de recherche sont indéniables. Ils ont certainement simplifié nos vies. Ce que nous ne tirons pas de l'utilisation de ces appareils et applications, c'est l'augmentation de la capacité à comprendre l'orientation spatiale et la navigation.

Pour renouveler ou acquérir ces compétences, essayez d'utiliser des cartes physiques pour planifier votre prochain voyage. Après quelques voyages, vous serez agréablement surpris de constater à quel point une carte physique peut être utile.

3. Photographie
Même la photographie amateur nécessite une connaissance de base de l'éclairage, de la profondeur et de la composition. Cela est vrai pour la photographie numérique. La plupart des appareils photo intelligents effectuent automatiquement ces ajustements. Nous n'avons plus besoin d'apprendre l'art de la photographie. Sur la plupart des appareils, cela peut être facilement modifié en désactivant les paramètres automatiques. Expérimentez en réglant manuellement les modes de scène, l'éclairage et le zoom. Vous découvrirez peut-être que vous êtes un ""véritable photographe"".

"Traditionnellement considéré comme l'un des avions les plus sûrs du ciel, la réputation du Boeing 777 a été ternie par le deuxième accident mortel en moins d'un an. Il y a environ 1 000 Boeing 777 en service, et l'avion est un véritable bourreau de travail sur les longs trajets, assurant certains des trajets les plus longs. Il est entré en service en 1995 et le National Transportation Safety Board, qui est responsable de la surveillance des avions américains, a enregistré moins de 60 incidents. Mais le bilan récent a été plus contrasté avec deux incidents majeurs : un accident à l'aéroport de San Francisco en juillet dernier, qui a fait trois morts, et l'atterrissage forcé d'un Boeing 777 de British Airways à Heathrow en janvier 2008.
Cependant, la catastrophe malaisienne est très différente à la fois de l'incident de BA et de l'accident impliquant un vol d'Asiana Airlines à l'aéroport international de San Francisco en juillet. Les accidents de BA et d'Asiana se sont produits peu de temps avant l'atterrissage, tandis que l'avion de Malaysia Airlines a disparu des radars au début du voyage.
L'accident de San Francisco en juillet a été attribué à une erreur de pilotage qui a conduit à la mise au ralenti des moteurs car il pensait que l'ordinateur maintiendrait une vitesse suffisante pour maintenir l'avion en l'air. Mais les premières informations suggèrent que Zaharie Ahmad Shah, le pilote malaisien de 53 ans, était extrêmement expérimenté : il avait rejoint la compagnie aérienne en 1981 et comptait 18 365 heures au compteur. L'atterrissage forcé de BA, qui n'a fait aucune victime, a finalement été attribué à un blocage dans la conduite d'alimentation en carburant du moteur. En termes simples, l'avion a subi l'équivalent d'un arrêt cardiaque dans l'aviation parce qu'une partie du carburant n'a pas fondu et a bloqué la conduite d'alimentation à la fin d'un long vol de Pékin à Londres, au cours duquel l'avion a traversé un espace aérien exceptionnellement froid au-dessus de la Sibérie.
_ fait penser à la catastrophe dans laquelle 288 personnes à bord d'un Airbus 330 d'Air France. Cet avion, un autre bourreau de travail sur les longs trajets, s'est écrasé dans l'Atlantique en route de Rio de Janeiro en juin 2009, faisant 228 morts. Différentes explications ont été données pour l'accident d'Air France, les enquêteurs ayant constaté que les capteurs de vitesse de l'avion donnaient une lecture incorrecte. Mais avec cet accident impliquant un avion différent, il faudra plusieurs mois avant que les enquêteurs ne puissent déterminer la cause.

"Aujourd'hui, seulement une personne sur cinq aux États-Unis vit à moins de 80 kilomètres de son lieu de naissance. Depuis la première colonisation du pays, les Américains se sont beaucoup déplacés et vivent souvent loin de leurs parents. Parce qu'ils ont rompu les liens avec leur passé à un jeune âge, choisi leurs propres professions, établi leurs propres foyers et développé leurs propres modes de vie, peu d'enfants américains grandissent entourés de près par leurs grands-parents, tantes, oncles et cousins comme c'est le cas en Italie, au Nigéria ou en Inde, par exemple. Cela, ajouté au fait que les familles américaines modernes n'ont pas de domestiques, a fait de la ""baby-sitter"" une partie vitale de la scène américaine. Une ""sitter"" est une personne qui est engagée pour s'occuper des enfants pendant une période donnée - généralement relativement courte - pendant que les parents sont sortis pour la soirée, pour une fête ou un cours d'étude par exemple. Parfois, la baby-sitter est également engagée pour une période plus longue, peut-être lorsque les parents sont absents pour un week-end. Dans de tels cas, la ""sitter"" est susceptible d'être une femme mature et maternelle. Pour de courtes périodes, des adolescents, des étudiants, des étudiants en soins infirmiers et d'autres personnes sont généralement employés sur une base horaire.
Du point de vue de la commodité, les meilleures nounous sont souvent de jeunes gens qui vivent dans votre immeuble ou à proximité dans le quartier. Cela vous donne l'occasion de rencontrer les parents et de voir à quoi ils ressemblent. En cas d'urgence, les jeunes nounous peuvent faire appel à leurs parents rapidement pour obtenir de l'aide ; vous n'avez pas à les emmener loin pour les raccompagner à la maison le soir ou à payer des taxis coûteux. Un autre avantage est que les jeunes gens vivant à proximité peuvent généralement se rendre disponibles assez facilement à court préavis ou pour de courtes périodes de temps.
Dans un immeuble d'habitation, vous pouvez demander au concierge la permission d'afficher un avis pour une baby-sitter près des boîtes aux lettres. C'est souvent la meilleure façon de savoir s'il y a quelqu'un dans l'immeuble qui est intéressé par la garde d'enfants.

"Les chercheurs ont établi que lorsque les gens sont mentalement engagés, des changements biochimiques se produisent dans le cerveau qui lui permettent d'agir plus efficacement dans les domaines cognitifs tels que l'attention et la mémoire. Cela est vrai quel que soit l'âge.

Les gens seront attentifs et réceptifs s'ils sont confrontés à des informations qui les amènent à réfléchir à des choses qui les intéressent. Et une personne ayant l'habitude de faire plus plutôt que moins entrera dans la vieillesse avec un esprit plus sain qu'une personne qui n'a pas eu un esprit actif.

De nombreux experts sont tellement convaincus des avantages de mettre le cerveau au défi qu'ils mettent la théorie en pratique dans leur propre vie. ""L'idée n'est pas nécessairement d'apprendre à mémoriser de grandes quantités d'informations"", explique James Fozard, directeur adjoint du National Institute of Ageing. ""La plupart d'entre nous n'avons pas besoin de ce genre de compétence. Une formation aussi spécifique est moins intéressante que la capacité à maintenir une vigilance mentale."" Fozard et d'autres affirment qu'ils mettent leurs cerveaux au défi avec différentes compétences mentales, à la fois parce qu'ils les apprécient et parce qu'ils sont sûrs que leur éventail d'activités aidera le fonctionnement de leur cerveau.

Gene Cohen, directeur par intérim du même institut, suggère que les personnes âgées devraient s'engager dans des activités mentales et physiques individuellement ainsi qu'en groupe. Cohen dit qu'on nous conseille fréquemment de rester physiquement actifs en vieillissant, mais que les personnes âgées doivent aussi rester mentalement actives. Ceux qui le font sont plus susceptibles de maintenir leurs capacités intellectuelles et d'être généralement plus heureux et mieux adaptés. ""Le point est que vous devez faire les deux"", dit Cohen.

La Chine a ses propres fêtes, comme le Nouvel An chinois et la fête de la mi-automne, nous n'avons donc pas besoin de célébrer les fêtes d'autres pays. Certaines personnes dépensent beaucoup d'argent pour célébrer le jour de Noël. Les gens achètent beaucoup de cadeaux pour leurs amis et leurs familles, mais ce n'est pas la meilleure façon de montrer leur amour.

"Le caractère ""duang"" est si nouveau qu'il n'existe même pas dans le dictionnaire chinois. Mais il s'est déjà répandu comme une traînée de poudre en ligne en Chine, apparaissant plus de 8 millions de fois sur le site de microblogging chinois Weibo, où il a engendré un hashtag parmi les plus tendances qui a suscité 312 000 discussions parmi 15 000 utilisateurs. Sur le plus grand moteur de recherche en ligne de Chine, Baidu, il a été recherché près de 600 000 fois. Il a également été remarqué en Occident, Foreign Policy le considérant comme un mème viral ""qui casse internet"" - comme une certaine image de Kim Kardashian, ou une certaine robe multicolore.
Mais que signifie-t-il ? ""Tout le monde ""duang"" et je ne sais toujours pas ce que ça veut dire ! Comme si j'étais de retour à l'école pour moi"", a déclaré l'utilisateur de Weibo Weileiweito. Un autre utilisateur a demandé : ""Avez-vous ""duang""é aujourd'hui ? Mon esprit est plein de ""duang duang duang""."" ""Duang ou ne pas duang, telle est la question"", a écrit l'utilisateur BaiKut automan.
""Duang"" semble être un exemple d'onomatopée, un mot qui imite phonétiquement un son. Tout semble avoir commencé avec la star de cinéma d'action de Hong Kong Jackie Chan, qui, en 2004, a été présenté dans une publicité pour un shampooing où il a défendu avec éclat ses cheveux lisses et noirs en utilisant le ""duang"" au son rythmique. Le mot a refait surface récemment après que Chan l'a posté sur sa page Weibo. Des milliers d'utilisateurs ont alors commencé à inonder la page Weibo de Chan avec des commentaires, inventant le mot en référence à son apparition infâme dans la publicité pour le shampooing.
Le mot semble avoir de nombreuses significations différentes, et il n'y a pas de traduction parfaite, mais vous pouvez l'utiliser comme un adjectif pour mettre l'accent sur le mot qui le suit. Un chaton pourrait être ""duang mignon"", par exemple. Ou vous pourriez être ""très duang confus"" par ce blog.
Pour les lecteurs de caractères chinois, le thème de Jackie Chan est également apparent dans la manière particulière dont le mot est écrit : une combinaison des noms mandarins de Chan.

"J'avais la mère la plus méchante du monde. Alors que les autres enfants mangeaient des bonbons au petit-déjeuner, je devais manger des céréales, des œufs ou des toasts. Alors que d'autres mangeaient du Coca et des bonbons au déjeuner, je devais manger un sandwich. Comme vous pouvez le deviner, mon dîner était également différent de celui des autres enfants. Mais au moins, je n'étais pas seul dans mes souffrances. Ma sœur et mes deux frères avaient la même mère que moi.
Ma mère insistait pour savoir où nous étions à tout moment. Elle devait savoir qui étaient nos amis et où nous allions. Elle insistait pour que si nous disions que nous partirions une heure, nous partions une heure ou moins, pas une heure et une minute. Et elle insistait toujours pour que nous disions la vérité. Maintenant, vous pouvez voir à quel point elle était méchante.
Le pire reste à venir. Nous devions être au lit à neuf heures chaque soir et nous lever à huit heures le lendemain matin. Nous devions faire la vaisselle, faire les lits et apprendre à cuisiner. Nous devions porter des vêtements propres et prendre un bain, alors que les autres enfants portaient toujours leurs vêtements pendant des jours. Je crois qu'elle restait éveillée la nuit et pensait à nous faire des choses méchantes.
Au fil des années, les choses ne se sont pas améliorées du tout. Nous ne pouvions pas rester au lit, « malades » comme nos amis, et manquer l'école. Nos notes à l'école devaient être à la hauteur. Les bulletins de notes de nos amis étaient de belles couleurs, noir pour la réussite, rouge pour l'échec. Ma mère, aussi différente qu'elle était, ne se contentait de rien de moins que de vilaines notes noires.
Au fil des années, nous avons été un par un humiliés. Nous avons obtenu notre diplôme d'études secondaires. Avec notre mère derrière nous, parlant, frappant et exigeant le respect, aucun de nous n'a eu le plaisir d'avoir abandonné ses études.
Ma mère a été une mère ratée. Sur quatre enfants, deux d'entre nous ont fait des études supérieures. Et à qui devons-nous imputer la responsabilité de la façon dont nous avons tourné ? Vous avez raison, notre mère méchante. Elle nous a forcés à devenir des adultes instruits et honnêtes.
Maintenant, j'essaie d'élever mes trois enfants. Je suis remplie de fierté quand mes enfants me traitent de méchante. Parce que, voyez-vous, j’avais la mère la plus méchante du monde entier.","{

"Une langue peut disparaître lorsque la dernière personne capable de la parler décède. Ou plus probablement, lorsque l'avant-dernière personne qui la parle meurt, car il ne reste alors plus personne à qui parler. Selon les linguistes, il n'y a rien d'exceptionnel à la disparition d'une seule langue. Mais ce qui se produit aujourd'hui est assez remarquable. Selon les statistiques récentes, il existe environ 6 000 langues dans le monde à l'heure actuelle. Parmi celles-ci, environ la moitié devrait disparaître au cours du siècle prochain.

Il existe plusieurs raisons pour lesquelles une langue peut finir par disparaître. Celles-ci vont des catastrophes naturelles, telles que les ouragans, aux facteurs sociologiques, comme l'assimilation culturelle, dans laquelle la culture d'un groupe minoritaire est progressivement remplacée par une culture plus forte. La première peut entraîner le départ des tribus de leur habitat naturel et donc une diminution de leur nombre. Cependant, cela ne se produit pas très fréquemment. En fait, la seconde est une menace bien plus importante et elle est responsable de l'extinction de nombreuses langues dans des pays comme les États-Unis et l'Australie. Par exemple, le Chemehuevi est l'une des langues qui est sur le point de disparaître, car son seul locuteur est un homme âgé mais en bonne santé nommé Johnny Hill, Jr.

Il est très important de préserver le plus grand nombre possible de langues. Les scientifiques tentent de sensibiliser la population au fait que certaines tribus possèdent des mots spécifiques qui ne peuvent pas être exprimés en anglais, par exemple, simplement parce qu'il n'y a pas d'équivalent. Notamment, les Yupik d'Alaska ont 99 noms pour décrire différentes couches de formation de glace, ou la façon dont les Tofa de Sibérie classent les rennes. En d'autres termes, lorsque les langues disparaissent, la sagesse de l'humanité diminue.

Sur une note plus positive, il existe de nombreux cas célèbres qui montrent ce qui peut être fait pour préserver les langues en danger d'extinction. En particulier, les Maoris de Nouvelle-Zélande ont créé ce que l'on appelle des ""nids de langues"" : des organisations qui aident les enfants de moins de cinq ans à apprendre la langue. Ils leur fournissent un environnement où ils sont exposés intensivement à la langue afin qu'ils réalisent que communiquer en maori est aussi naturel que communiquer en anglais. Bien sûr, il y a toujours le risque que les enfants ne maintiennent pas la langue en vie après avoir quitté leurs ""nids"". Néanmoins, l'espoir meurt en dernier.

"Mon intérêt pour la cuisine chinoise a commencé dans les années 90, alors que j'étais jeune reporter pour le Washington Post. Notre bureau n'était pas loin de Chinatown, où j'ai trouvé de très bons restaurants chinois.

La première fois que j'ai mangé de la cuisine chinoise, j'ai adoré. J'ai remarqué le goût frais de la viande et des légumes. En apprenant davantage sur la cuisine, j'ai commencé à comprendre pourquoi elle possédait cette caractéristique particulière.

Il y a de nombreuses années, la Chine a connu une crise énergétique car elle a perdu une grande partie de son bois en raison de la surpopulation et de la mauvaise gestion de ses forêts. Cette perte a été très mauvaise pour le pays, bien sûr, mais elle s'est avérée très bénéfique pour la cuisine. Le bois est devenu très cher et difficile à obtenir, ce qui a obligé les Chinois à trouver un substitut à leur bois précieux ou à apprendre à mieux l'utiliser. Il n'y avait pas de substituts, les gens ont donc trouvé des moyens de faire des économies.

Afin d'économiser en cuisine, ils devaient utiliser très peu de bois. Ils ont donc commencé à couper leur viande et leurs légumes en petits morceaux avant de les mettre dans l'huile chaude. De cette façon, la nourriture cuisait plus rapidement et ils économisaient leur combustible. La nourriture préparée de cette manière conservait sa saveur fraîche et c'est cette saveur qui attire les gens d'autres pays vers l'art de la cuisine chinoise.

""Oh,"" répondit le petit garçon, la tête baissée. Levant les yeux, il dit : ""Papa, peux-tu me prêter 10 dollars ?""
Le père était furieux.

L'homme s'assit et commença à être encore plus en colère à cause des questions du petit garçon. Comment osait-il poser de telles questions juste pour obtenir de l'argent ?

L'homme alla à la porte de la chambre du petit garçon et l'ouvrit. ""Tu dors, mon fils ?"" demanda-t-il. ""Non papa, je suis réveillé,"" répondit le garçon.

Le petit garçon se redressa, souriant. ""Oh, merci papa !"" s'exclama-t-il. Puis, en cherchant sous son oreiller, il sortit des billets froissés.

"Il est souvent nécessaire de relâcher un poisson, c'est-à-dire de le libérer après l'avoir pêché, car il est trop petit ou vous ne voulez tout simplement pas le ramener à la maison pour le manger. Dans certains cas, la remise à l'eau des poissons est une bonne mesure qui contribuera à maintenir la variété des poissons et à accroître leur population. Le Département des jeux et des pêches d'eau douce (DGIF) encourage les pêcheurs qui pratiquent la pêche à la remise à l'eau à utiliser quelques techniques simples lorsqu'ils le font. Les conseils fournis ci-dessous vous aideront à vous assurer que les poissons que vous relâchez survivront pour mordre à nouveau un autre jour.
 
 --Lorsque vous capturez un poisson, jouez-y rapidement et gardez-le le plus possible dans l'eau.
N'utilisez pas de filet pour le ramener à terre et relâchez-le rapidement pour éviter qu'il ne meure.
--Tenez le poisson doucement. Ne mettez pas vos doigts dans ses yeux. N'essuyez pas les écailles du poisson car cela pourrait provoquer une maladie et réduire ses chances de survie.
--Retirez votre hameçon rapidement. Si l'hameçon est trop profond ou s'il est accroché à l'estomac, coupez la ligne et laissez l'hameçon en place. L'hameçon laissé à l'intérieur ne causera aucun problème grave au poisson.
--Prenez soin du poisson en le déplaçant doucement dans l'eau. Relâchez le poisson lorsqu'il commence à se débattre et qu'il est capable de nager.
--Ne mettez pas le poisson dans un seau ou un autre récipient et ne décidez pas plus tard de le relâcher. Si vous allez relâcher un poisson, faites-le tout de suite.
 
 Avec un peu de soin et en suivant les suggestions données ci-dessus, vous pouvez donner au poisson relâché une meilleure chance de survie.

"Les avantages à long terme de l'apprentissage des bonnes habitudes financières pour les enfants valent bien l'effort. Les enfants qui ne reçoivent pas ces leçons en paient les conséquences toute leur vie. Certains parents n'enseignent pas leurs enfants sur l'argent parce qu'ils pensent qu'ils ne devraient pas parler d'argent avec les enfants, qu'ils n'ont pas le temps ou qu'ils n'ont pas assez d'argent. Les parents devraient prendre le temps d'apprendre aux enfants l'argent, quel que soit leur revenu, et devraient commencer dès le plus jeune âge.

La plupart des gens ont des sentiments et des opinions forts sur l'argent, basés sur leurs expériences d'enfance et sur les valeurs et les croyances de leur famille. Le plus souvent, ces expériences, valeurs et croyances sont différentes pour chaque parent. Il est important pour le développement sain des enfants que les parents parlent de ces sentiments et opinions et établissent une approche cohérente pour apprendre l'argent aux enfants.

Voici quelques directives que les parents peuvent garder à l'esprit lorsqu'ils commencent la socialisation financière de leurs enfants :

* Conseillez plutôt que d'ordonner comment l'argent de l'enfant devrait être utilisé.
* Permettez aux enfants d'apprendre de leurs erreurs et de leurs succès.
* Soyez cohérent tout en tenant compte des différences des enfants.
* Incluez tous les membres de la famille dans les discussions sur la gestion de l'argent, la prise de décisions et les activités adaptées à leur âge.
* Expliquez aux enfants ce qu'ils peuvent et ne peuvent pas faire et les conséquences de dépasser les limites.
* Au fur et à mesure que les enfants grandissent, incluez-les de plus en plus dans les discussions sur les limites et les conséquences.
* Attendez-vous à ce que tous les membres de la famille effectuent des tâches ménagères non rémunérées et routinières en fonction de leurs capacités.
* Exprimez votre désir d'avoir des choses que vous ne pouvez pas vous permettre. Les enfants doivent savoir que les parents se disent « non » à eux-mêmes aussi.

"Le mot ""mort"" est un mot que beaucoup de mes amis chinois me disent de ne pas prononcer à haute voix. Ils me conseillent d'éviter ce mot car le simple fait de le dire pourrait apporter la malchance. Je crois profondément, cependant, que pour savoir vivre, il faut aussi savoir mourir. Le problème est la façon dont nous parlons de la mort.

Comme tous les habitants de Taiwan cette semaine, j'ai célébré le ""Jour du balayage des tombes"". Je suis fier de faire partie d'un peuple dont la culture envoie des millions de familles dans les cimetières en ce jour spécial pour partager des souvenirs et un amour sans fin.

Aujourd'hui, huit jours après la mort du pape Jean-Paul II, des millions de personnes de tous horizons pleurent encore son décès. C'était une personne profondément humaine qui savait rire et montrer ses émotions, un écrivain doué pour les mots, un leader qui nous a touchés par la simple lumière de son amour pour la vie.

Le même jour et quelques heures avant que le Saint-Père ne nous quitte, une amie à moi nommée Veronica McBride est morte d'un cancer dans une petite ville du Wisconsin. Mon amie Veronica avait 52 ans. C'était une jeune femme attirante et humoristique qui, comme on dit, ""ne s'est jamais mariée"". Elle a publié plusieurs livres d'humour avec sa mère, Mary McBride. Elle aimait voyager et, pendant des années, elle envoyait des cartes de Noël avec des photos d'elle debout à côté de monuments ou d'animaux étranges. Elle a lutté contre le cancer pendant cinq ans. Elle plaisantait sur son traitement qui la gardait belle parce qu'il la gardait mince, et me disait qu'elle ne craignait pas de perdre ses cheveux à cause de cela. ""Je peux porter de belles perruques !""

La dernière fois que j'ai vu Veronica, c'était lors d'une visite à sa famille un jour ensoleillé d'août 2003. Lorsqu'elle est entrée en trombe dans la maison plus tard et m'a vu dans le salon, elle m'a complètement ignorée dans sa hâte d'embrasser son nouveau neveu, me laissant secouer la tête en riant de son attitude.

En regardant la signification du Saint-Père et de sa vie, nous devons certainement garder les yeux ouverts pour voir la merveille et la bonté dans les gens ordinaires qui nous montrent comment vivre et comment mourir.

"Lee Kuan Yew est apparu sur la scène internationale en tant que père fondateur de Singapour, alors une ville d'environ un million d'habitants. Il est devenu un homme d'État mondial qui a agi comme une sorte de conscience pour les dirigeants du monde entier.

Le destin ne semblait pas lui avoir initialement offert une scène sur laquelle il aurait pu atteindre plus qu'un succès local modeste. Dans la première phase de la décolonisation, Singapour est apparue comme faisant partie de la Malaisie. Elle a été séparée en raison des tensions entre la population majoritairement chinoise de Singapour et la majorité malaise et, surtout, pour donner à la ville une leçon de dépendance.

Mais les grands hommes deviennent tels par le biais de visions qui dépassent les calculs matériels. Lee a remis en question la sagesse conventionnelle en optant pour l'étathood. Ce choix reflétait une profonde foi dans les vertus de son peuple. Il a affirmé qu'une ville située sur un banc de sable sans ressources économiques à exploiter, et dont la principale industrie en tant que base navale coloniale avait disparu, pouvait néanmoins prospérer et acquérir une réputation internationale en s'appuyant sur son principal atout : l'intelligence, l'industrie et le dévouement de son peuple.

Un grand leader emmène sa société d'où elle est à un endroit où elle n'est jamais allée – en fait, où elle ne peut pas encore imaginer aller. En insistant sur l'éducation de qualité, en supprimant la corruption et en fondant la gouvernance sur le mérite, Lee et ses collègues ont fait passer le revenu annuel par habitant de leur population de 500 dollars au moment de l'indépendance en 1965 à environ 55 000 dollars aujourd'hui. En une génération, Singapour est devenue un centre financier international, la principale métropole intellectuelle de l'Asie du Sud-Est, l'emplacement des principaux hôpitaux de la région et un lieu privilégié pour les conférences sur les affaires internationales. Elle l'a fait en adhérant à un pragmatisme extraordinaire : en ouvrant des carrières aux meilleurs talents et en les encourageant à adopter les meilleures pratiques du monde entier.

La performance supérieure était une composante de cette réussite. Le leadership supérieur était encore plus important. Au fil des décennies, il était émouvant – et inspirant – de voir Lee, le maire d'une ville de taille moyenne, devenir un mentor de l'ordre stratégique mondial.

La grande tragédie de la vie de Lee est que sa femme bien-aimée a été frappée par un AVC qui l'a laissée prisonnière de son corps, incapable de communiquer ou de recevoir des communications. Pendant tout ce temps, Lee s'est assis à son chevet le soir pour lui lire. Il avait foi qu'elle comprenait malgré les preuves contraires.

C'était peut-être le rôle de Lee Kuan Yew dans son époque. Il avait le même espoir pour notre monde. Il s'est battu pour ses meilleurs instincts, même lorsque les preuves étaient ambiguës. Mais beaucoup d'entre nous l'ont entendu et ne l'oublieront jamais.

Comment vas-tu ? J'ai quelque chose d'intéressant à te raconter. La semaine dernière, nous avons fait une excursion au Mont Tai. Mardi, nous sommes allés à Taian en bus, une ville au pied de la montagne. Nous avons bien reposé dans un hôtel. Vers une heure du matin, nous avons commencé à grimper la montagne. Il nous a fallu environ quatre heures et demie pour atteindre le sommet. La montagne est recouverte d'arbres. Je n'avais jamais vu un endroit aussi beau auparavant.

Nous nous sommes tous tournés vers l'est et avons observé. Bientôt, la moitié du ciel est devenue blanche, et un gros ballon rouge s'élevait lentement. Quelques minutes plus tard, le ciel est devenu lumineux.

Nous sommes restés au sommet et nous avons passé un bon moment. Après le déjeuner, nous avons commencé à descendre. Nous sommes arrivés à l'hôtel de tourisme vers quatre heures de l'après-midi. Bien que nous soyons fatigués, nous étions très heureux. Nous sommes retournés à l'école le lendemain.

"La meilleure façon de découvrir Liverpool est en bateau. La première chose à faire est de prendre un ferry (bateau) pour traverser la rivière Mersey. C'est la meilleure façon de découvrir la longue et intéressante histoire de cette ville. Le Liverpool Ferry, qui est le plus ancien service de ferry d'Europe, a débuté il y a plus de 800 ans.

Au XVIIIe siècle, Liverpool est devenue une ville importante pour le commerce international à travers l'océan Atlantique. Des navires partaient de Liverpool vers les États-Unis et l'Afrique. Le meilleur endroit pour en savoir plus sur l'importance de Liverpool est le musée maritime.

Liverpool était importante en raison de son industrie et de son commerce au XVIIIe siècle. Au XXe siècle, elle est devenue célèbre pour sa musique. Les membres du groupe de rock, les Beatles, venaient tous de Liverpool. La ville est très fière d'eux. Elle a donné le nom de John Lennon International Airport à son aéroport, en hommage à l'un des Beatles. Les touristes peuvent faire un tour en bus pour visiter certains des endroits mentionnés par les Beatles dans leurs chansons, comme Penny Lane et Strawberry Fields. Ils peuvent également visiter le Cavern Club - le groupe y a joué pour la première fois en 1961. The Beatles Story est un musée et une galerie. Vous pouvez y découvrir davantage sur ces musiciens de renommée mondiale.

Mais il y a bien plus à voir et à faire à Liverpool. À la Walker Art Gallery, vous pouvez voir les meilleures œuvres d'art du nord de l'Angleterre. Si vous aimez l'art moderne, l'endroit à visiter est la Tate Gallery. Mais par-dessus tout, ce sont les habitants accueillants et chaleureux de Liverpool qui font de cette ville un endroit à visiter lorsque vous venez en Grande-Bretagne.

"La Coupe de Cheveux de David

Quand David sort de la porte d'entrée, il est aveuglé un instant par la lumière blanche et forte du soleil et tend automatiquement la main à son père. C'est le premier jour vraiment chaud de l'année, une chaleur inattendue qui comble le fossé entre le printemps et l'été. Père et fils sont en route pour le salon de coiffure, une habitude qu'ils ont toujours eue ensemble.

Toujours, la routine est la même. ""Il est temps de te faire couper cette tignasse,"" dira le père de David, en le désignant du doigt, une cigarette coincée entre les deux. ""Peut-être que je devrais le faire moi-même. Où sont ces ciseaux, Janet ?"" Parfois, son père le poursuit dans le salon, en feignant de lui couper les oreilles. Quand il était jeune, David avait l'habitude de s'exciter et de se mettre à pleurer, de peur qu'il ne perde vraiment ses oreilles, mais il a depuis longtemps dépassé cette étape.

Le salon de coiffure de M. Samuels est situé dans une longue pièce au-dessus du magasin de frites, accessible par un escalier raide et usé. David suit son père. Il adore le salon de coiffure - c'est comme nulle part ailleurs où il va. Ça sent la cigarette, les hommes et l'huile à cheveux. Parfois, l'odeur des frites monte l'escalier avec un client et quand la porte s'ouvre, les hommes qui attendent lèvent le nez en même temps. Des photographies en noir et blanc d'hommes avec diverses coiffures démodées sont accrochées au-dessus d'une corniche au fond de la pièce, où deux fauteuils de barbier sont fixés au sol. Ce sont de lourds fauteuils à l'ancienne avec des pompes à pied qui grincent quand M. Samuels ajuste la hauteur du siège. Devant les fauteuils se trouvent de profondes vasques avec une pomme de douche et un long tuyau en métal attaché aux robinets, sans que personne ne semble les utiliser. Derrière les vasques se trouvent des miroirs et de chaque côté de ceux-ci, des étagères débordant de toutes sortes de peignes en plastique, de gobelets à raser, de ciseaux, de rasoirs à lame tranchante, de brosses à cheveux et de 10 bouteilles de Brylcreem rouge vif, empilées soigneusement en pyramide. Au fond de la pièce, les clients sont assis, silencieux la plupart du temps, sauf lorsque M. Samuels interrompt sa coupe et fume sa cigarette, envoyant une fumée gris-bleu comme la queue d'un cerf-volant qui se tord dans l'air.

Quand vient le tour de David de se faire couper les cheveux, M. Samuels place une planche en bois recouverte d'un morceau de cuir rouge sur les accoudoirs du fauteuil, de sorte que le barbier n'ait pas à se pencher pour couper les cheveux du garçon. David grimpe sur la banquette.

""Hé, jeune homme, tu grandis, tu n'auras bientôt plus besoin de ça, tu pourras t'asseoir sur la chaise,"" dit le barbier.

""Wow,"" dit David, se retournant pour regarder son père, oubliant qu'il peut le voir dans le miroir. ""Papa, M. Samuels a dit que je pourrais bientôt m'asseoir sur la chaise, pas juste sur la planche !""

""C'est ce que j'ai entendu,"" répond son père, sans lever les yeux de son journal.

""Au moins le double du prix,"" dit M. Samuels en faisant un clin d'œil à David.

Enfin, le père de David lève les yeux de son journal et jette un coup d'œil dans le miroir, voyant son fils lui faire face. Il sourit.

""Il n'y a pas si longtemps que je devais te hisser sur cette planche parce que tu ne pouvais pas y grimper tout seul,"" dit-il.

""Ils ne restent pas jeunes longtemps, les enfants,"" déclare M. Samuels. Tous les hommes du salon acquiescent. David aussi.

Dans le miroir, il voit une petite tête qui sort d'une longue cape en nylon. De temps en temps, il jette des coups d'œil furtifs au barbier pendant qu'il travaille. Il sent un mélange de sueur nauséabonde et d'eau de Cologne alors que le barbier se déplace autour de lui, peignant et coupant, peignant et coupant.

David a l'impression d'être dans un autre monde, silencieux, à part le bruit des chaussures du barbier qui frottent sur le tapis en plastique et le clic de ses ciseaux. Dans le reflet de la fenêtre qu'il pouvait voir à travers la vitre, quelques petits nuages se déplaçaient lentement dans le cadre, se déplaçant au son du clic des ciseaux.

Somnolent, les yeux tombant vers l'avant de la cape où ses cheveux tombent doucement comme la neige et il imagine s'asseoir sur la chaise comme les hommes et les garçons plus âgés, la banquette spéciale laissée inclinée contre le mur dans le coin. Il pense au livre d'images d'histoires bibliques que sa tante lui a offert pour Noël, celui de Samson se faisant couper les cheveux par Dalila. David se demande si sa force va disparaître comme celle de Samson.

Quand M. Samuels a fini, David saute de son siège, se frottant les cheveux qui lui démangent le visage. En regardant vers le bas, il voit ses propres cheveux épais et blonds mêlés aux bruns, aux gris et aux noirs des hommes qui se sont assis sur la chaise avant lui.

Ils arrivent sur le trottoir devant le magasin. ""Je te dis quoi, mon garçon, allons chercher du poisson et des frites à emporter, ça évitera à ta mère de faire le dîner,"" dit le père de David et il tourne dans la rue.

Le jeune homme est excité et attrape la main de son père. Les doigts épais et rugueux se referment doucement sur les siens et David est surpris de trouver, se réchauffant dans la paume de son père, une poignée de ses propres cheveux.

"  À qui vous sentez-vous le plus proche - votre mère ou votre père ?
Dans presque toutes les cultures du monde, les mères sont considérées comme plus importantes que les pères dans le développement des enfants et plus susceptibles de tisser des liens forts avec leurs enfants.
Cette croyance existait depuis longtemps jusqu'à ce que les scientifiques commencent à se poser une nouvelle question : que contribuent les pères à leurs enfants au-delà de leurs gènes ? Ils doivent bien signifier quelque chose, sinon ils auraient disparu de la vie des enfants à une époque antérieure de l'évolution. Une nouvelle science de la paternité est donc née.
Le journaliste américain Paul Raeburn a rassemblé les découvertes au fil des ans et les a regroupées dans son nouveau livre, Do Fathers Matter ? What Science Is Telling Us About the Parent We've Overlooked, dans l'espoir de faire mieux comprendre aux gens les nombreuses façons dont les pères influencent leurs enfants.
Par exemple, Ronald Preston Rohner, un scientifique de l'Université du Connecticut, aux États-Unis, a passé plusieurs années à étudier comment l'acceptation ou le rejet par les parents influence la personnalité des enfants. Il a constaté que les enfants acceptés par leurs deux parents sont généralement indépendants et ont une vision positive du monde, tandis que ceux qui se sentent rejetés par l'un ou l'autre parent peuvent devenir hostiles et négatifs.
Melanie Horn-Mallers, psychologue à l'Université d'État de Californie, a constaté que les fils qui ont des souvenirs heureux de leurs pères sont mieux à même de gérer le stress quotidien après avoir grandi.
Une autre étude, menée par Richard Koestner de l'Université McGill au Canada, s'est concentrée sur la façon dont les enfants développent l'empathie. Après avoir examiné divers facteurs possibles, Koestner en a trouvé un qui était plus important que les autres - le temps que leurs pères passent avec eux.
""Nous avons été surpris de constater que l'affection des parents envers leurs enfants n'avait pas beaucoup d'importance pour le développement de l'empathie"", a déclaré Koestner. ""Et nous avons été stupéfaits de la force de l'influence du père.""
En effet, les preuves montrent que les pères apportent des contributions uniques au bonheur de leurs enfants. Cependant, cela ne signifie pas que les enfants de familles sans pères sont forcément destinés à l'échec. Il suffit de regarder le président américain Barack Obama. Il est un excellent exemple de ce que peuvent réaliser les personnes qui grandissent dans des foyers monoparentaux.

"  Avez-vous déjà vu un ours polaire ? Peut-être lors d'un voyage au zoo ? Si vous aviez participé à une activité hivernale à New York il y a quelques années, vous auriez vu tout un club d'ours polaires. Ces ""Ours polaires"" sont des personnes qui se rencontrent fréquemment en hiver pour nager dans l'eau glacée. Ce jour-là, la température de l'air était de 3 degrés. Et la température de l'eau était un peu plus élevée. Les membres du Polar Bear Club de Coney Island, New York, ont généralement environ 60 ans. Les membres doivent satisfaire à deux exigences. Tout d'abord, ils doivent bien s'entendre avec tous les autres membres du groupe ; c'est très important car il y a tellement de types de personnes différentes dans le club. Les ours polaires doivent également accepter de nager en plein air au moins deux fois par mois de novembre à février.
Les médecins ne sont pas d'accord sur les effets médicaux de la natation en eau froide. Certains s'inquiètent des dangers d'une condition dans laquelle la température du corps baisse si lentement que finalement le cœur s'arrête. D'autres médecins, cependant, soulignent qu'il y a plus de risques de crise cardiaque pendant la natation estivale car la différence entre la température de l'air et la température de l'eau est beaucoup plus importante en été qu'en hiver.
Les ours polaires eux-mêmes sont satisfaits des avantages de la natation en eau froide. Ils disent que leur forme d'exercice préférée est très bonne pour le système circulatoire car elle oblige le sang à circuler rapidement pour maintenir le corps au chaud. Les nageurs en eau froide deviennent généralement rouges vifs après quelques minutes dans l'eau. Une personne qui devient bleue a probablement un très mauvais système circulatoire et ne pourrait pas essayer la natation en eau froide.
Les principaux avantages de la natation en eau froide sont probablement mentaux. Les ours polaires adorent nager toute l'année ; ils trouvent cela amusant et relaxant. Comme le dit une femme de 70 ans, ""Quand je vais dans l'eau, je verse mes soucis dans l'océan et les laisse flotter.""

"Mais pour la plupart des enfants, les étiquettes appliquées tôt dans la vie ont tendance à coller, même si elles sont fausses.
Le tri des écoliers en fonction de leurs capacités est depuis longtemps controversé. Dans certains pays, en particulier en Asie, le suivi à l'échelle de l'école reste la norme. Les enfants sont testés et placés dans différentes écoles qui les orientent vers des carrières professionnelles ou professionnelles. Les mouvements entre les pistes sont rares.
Le suivi à l'échelle de l'école a diminué dans les écoles américaines dans les années 1960 et 1970. Il ne s'est jamais éteint, cependant. Le tri des élèves en groupes distincts pour les mathématiques vers l'âge du collège continue d'être courant, et d'autres formes de suivi persistent également.
Contrairement au suivi, qui consiste à trier les élèves dans des salles de classe distinctes, le regroupement par niveau se produit au sein des salles de classe. Lorsqu'il est effectué conformément aux dernières recherches, il s'est avéré favoriser la réussite.
Le regroupement par niveau est modifiable et temporaire. Au sein des salles de classe, les élèves peuvent être divisés en différents groupes d'apprentissage traitant des matériaux de différents niveaux. Tous les élèves qui maîtrisent les concepts peuvent passer d'un groupe à l'autre, et les groupes d'élèves peuvent sembler différents d'un sujet à l'autre et d'une unité à l'autre. Par exemple, un élève qui se distingue en arts du langage peut être à un niveau moyen ou plus lent en mathématiques. Un élève qui dévore les tables de multiplication peut avoir besoin d'une aide supplémentaire avec les fractions. Les élèves qui sont en retard en lecture peuvent être retirés de la classe en petits groupes pour s'entraîner avec un tuteur jusqu'à ce que leur lecture s'améliore.
Les recherches montrent que le regroupement par niveau au sein des classes a plus d'avantages positifs que le suivi. Cependant, cela doit être mis en balance avec les défis que cela implique. Dans de nombreuses salles de classe ordinaires, les différences entre les niveaux de capacité des élèves sont très importantes. Cela pose des défis aux enseignants et aux élèves à faible performance de se comparer constamment à des élèves qui semblent traverser l'école avec aisance.
Les groupes de capacités rigides et le suivi du passé sont toujours présents dans de nombreuses écoles. Il est probable que les étiquettes sont appliquées avec plus de prudence qu'à la mauvaise époque où certains enseignants donnaient à des groupes de lecture des noms de code pas si secrets comme ""Bluebirds"", ""Robins"", ""Crows"" et ""Buzzards"". Mais les enfants le savent toujours.

"Anna Meier, une jeune fille autrichienne de 18 ans, poursuit ses parents en justice pour avoir publié plus de 500 photos d'elle sur Facebook depuis 2009, sans son autorisation.

Anna en a apparemment assez du refus de ses parents de supprimer les photos embarrassantes d'elle lorsqu'elle était jeune, et elle cherche maintenant justice devant les tribunaux. Elle a déclaré au magazine que même si elle avait 11 ans lorsque ses parents ont commencé à partager ses photos avec plusieurs centaines d'amis Facebook, ils sont allés jusqu'à publier des photos d'elle lorsqu'elle était bébé, sans jamais lui demander si cela lui convenait. ""Ils ne connaissaient ni la honte ni la limite - et ne se souciaient pas de savoir s'il s'agissait d'une photo de moi assise sur les toilettes ou allongée nue dans mon lit - chaque étape a été photographiée puis rendue publique"", a déclaré la jeune fille.

La jeune fille a ajouté qu'elle n'a pu voir les photos publiées sur Facebook par ses parents que lorsqu'elle avait 14 ans, après avoir créé son propre compte sur ce réseau social. À maintes reprises, Anna a demandé à ses parents de supprimer immédiatement les photos d'elle, mais ils ont refusé. Fâchée et contrariée, elle a estimé qu'elle n'avait d'autre choix que de les poursuivre en justice, ce qu'elle a fait dès qu'elle a eu 18 ans cette année. ""J'en ai assez de ne pas être prise au sérieux par mes parents"", a-t-elle déclaré.

L'avocat d'Anna affirme qu'ils ont de bonnes chances de gagner le procès devant les tribunaux, s'il peut être prouvé que les images ont violé ses droits à une vie privée. Mais, sur la base de cas similaires et conformément aux lois autrichiennes sur la protection de la vie privée, si les parents perdent, ils pourraient être condamnés à payer une amende de 3 000 à 10 000 euros à leur fille.

Cependant, les parents d'Anna ne voient aucun mal à publier des photos de leur fille lorsqu'elle était bébé. ""Je considère que j'ai le droit de publier ces photos"", a déclaré son père. ""Nous n'avons plus publié de photos de notre fille depuis qu'elle a cessé de nous autoriser à la photographier. Nous avons également des photos d'elle lorsqu'elle était bébé qui ne sont visibles que par un groupe limité de 700 amis Facebook.""

"Une nouvelle enquête mondiale suggère que les Chinois sont parmi les plus craintifs face au vieillissement.

Selon Bupa, une organisation britannique de santé, qui a interrogé 12 262 personnes dans 12 pays sur leurs attitudes envers le vieillissement, 28 % des Chinois interrogés ont déclaré se sentir déprimés à l'idée de vieillir.

Et bien que 72 % de tous les répondants âgés de 65 ans et plus aient déclaré ne pas se sentir vieux, l'enquête menée en juin et juillet de cette année a révélé que plus de la moitié des personnes âgées de 45 à 54 ans en Chine se considéraient déjà comme âgées. Environ 30 % des répondants chinois ont déclaré s'inquiéter de savoir qui s'occupera d'eux dans leurs vieux jours, tandis que 91 % étaient d'accord pour dire que le gouvernement de la nation la plus peuplée du monde devrait améliorer les soins aux personnes âgées.

Cependant, parce que les Chinois pensent à leur avenir plus tôt, des recherches suggèrent que le pays pourrait être l'un des mieux préparés pour faire face au problème du vieillissement. Environ un tiers des répondants chinois, soit plus du double de la moyenne mondiale, ont déclaré avoir mis de l'argent de côté pour leur retraite, tandis que 46 % ont souscrit une assurance, selon l'enquête. Malgré le fait d'être l'une des nations les mieux préparées, trois cinquièmes des personnes interrogées en Chine s'attendent à ce que leur famille s'occupe d'elles lorsqu'elles ne pourront plus le faire elles-mêmes.

Un rapport parrainé par Bupa a cependant révélé que le ""réseau de soins informels"" (le modèle traditionnel des familles qui s'occupent des personnes âgées) est en train de se désintégrer. Ceci est dû à un certain nombre de facteurs, a déclaré le rapport, notamment les changements structurels de la population, l'augmentation du nombre de femmes employées, l'augmentation des ménages à personne seule et la hausse des taux de divorce.

La première génération de couples chinois n'ayant qu'un seul enfant est largement dans la cinquantaine ou la soixantaine, car la politique de planification familiale du pays a été adoptée à la fin des années 1970.

"Chère Alice,

J'ai eu de tes nouvelles il y a trois jours. Je vais bien.

Bonne nouvelle ! On a déménagé dans un nouvel appartement hier ! Il y a plus de pièces ici que dans notre ancien appartement. Tu sais, je partageais une chambre avec ma sœur dans l’ancien. Mais maintenant j’ai ma propre chambre ! Elle est petite mais c’est ma préférée ! Je peux être seule dedans. Je peux lire des livres, dessiner, écouter la radio et les CD. Je peux aussi jouer à des jeux sur mon ordinateur et envoyer des e-mails à mes amis.

J’aime aussi la nouvelle cuisine plus grande. J’adore aider ma mère à préparer les repas. Maman cuisine bien. Elle m’apprend toujours à faire différents types de plats. Elle a vécu en Chine quand elle était jeune, donc elle sait cuisiner des plats chinois. C’est délicieux.

Écris-moi vite et raconte-moi ta maison. S’il te plaît, connecte-toi à internet pour qu’on puisse chatter ensemble.

Meilleures salutations !

"Un voleur sans cœur est soupçonné d'avoir infiltré une collecte de fonds et de s'être enfui avec un sac d'argent destiné à aider un pompier de New York à payer une opération qui allait changer la vie de son fils de 9 ans. Mais le jeune Aidan Sullivan, né avec une malformation faciale et sans oreille droite, a fait preuve de courage hier, avec un message pour le voleur : ""Je vais te botter le cul !""

""Je veux avoir l'air normal"", a déclaré Aidan, dont le père, Tim, est pompier dans le Bronx. L'élève de troisième année souffre d'une microsomie hémifaciale, dans laquelle une moitié du visage ne se développe pas correctement.

Le week-end dernier, un ami de la famille, Peter Drake, pompier à Ridgefield, dans le Connecticut, a organisé une collecte de fonds, recueillant entre 8 000 et 9 000 dollars. Mais lorsque la fête dans un centre culturel irlandais de Danbury, dans le Connecticut, s'est terminée, l'argent avait disparu.

""À la fin de la soirée, tout l'argent qui avait été donné a été mis dans un sac zippé"", a déclaré Tim Sullivan. ""Un barman a donné le sac à Pete... Il l'avait dans les mains. Il l'a posé pour aller faire quelque chose, et quand il est revenu, il a vu qu'il avait disparu.""

Sullivan a déclaré que son ami de longue date, qui a organisé des collectes de fonds pour payer les 10 précédentes interventions chirurgicales d'Aidan, est ""dévasté"".

""Pete était tellement contrarié. Il n'arrêtait pas de dire : ""J'ai laissé tomber Aidan, j'ai laissé tomber Aidan"", se souvient Colleen Sullivan, 40 ans.

""On a même fouillé dans les poubelles, au cas où il aurait été jeté.""

Les Sullivan prévoient de poursuivre l'opération du 1er mars dirigée par des spécialistes du centre médical Langone de la NYU à Manhattan. L'argent aurait permis de compenser les 10 000 à 15 000 dollars que l'assurance ne couvrait pas.

"Par une chaude journée d'été, Jonathan et ses camarades de classe étaient assis anxieusement dans leur salle de classe, attendant que la sonnerie finale de la journée retentisse. Jonathan priait pour que la cloche sonne bientôt, car il voulait rentrer chez lui rapidement avant que les trois gros et sales brutes ne le voient. Chaque jour, les trois brutes attendaient là un élève innocent pour se moquer de lui et le harceler.
Au moment où la sonnerie retentit, Jonathan se précipita dehors avec son sac. Il accéléra à travers le terrain de l'école et sur la passerelle. Cependant, tous ses efforts furent inutiles car les trois brutes étaient appuyées contre une clôture.
Jonathan pensa à traverser la rue à côté de lui, mais ce serait trop risqué. Alors il se cacha derrière un petit buisson dans l'espoir que les trois brutes s'en aillent. Mais il bougea trop vite et fut vu par l'un des brutes. Ils s'approchèrent de lui.
Un brute attrapa Jonathan par le col de sa chemise et lui prit l'argent de la poche pour le mettre dans la sienne.

"De nouvelles règles pour les pubs et les clubs, y compris l'interdiction des jeux de boisson tels que le terrible ""fauteuil de dentiste"", seront introduites en Grande-Bretagne cette année pour lutter contre la culture de la consommation excessive d'alcool, qui coûte des milliards de livres sterling au pays chaque année.
D'autres activités telles que les ""boissons à volonté pour 10 livres"", les soirées ""femmes boivent gratuitement"" et les concours de vitesse de consommation d'alcool seront également interdites.
Mais, d'un autre côté, les offres d'alcool bon marché dans les supermarchés ne seront pas affectées, ce qui est largement considéré comme l'une des principales sources des problèmes de consommation excessive d'alcool et de consommation d'alcool chez les mineurs en Grande-Bretagne.
Les médecins et les experts de la santé soutiennent que le gouvernement a échoué à utiliser son arme la plus efficace, la taxation et les contrôles de prix minimum sur l'alcool.
Le ministre de l'Intérieur, Alan Johnson, a déclaré que le gouvernement et l'industrie avaient le devoir d'agir contre la consommation excessive d'alcool. ""Ces interdictions ont un réel impact sur la société, sans parler de la vie de ceux qui veulent simplement passer une bonne soirée"", a-t-il déclaré.
Le ""fauteuil de dentiste"", où les boissons sont versées directement dans la bouche par d'autres, a été rendu célèbre par les célébrations du footballeur Paul Gascoigne à l'Euro '96. Ce jeu et d'autres qui encouragent une grande consommation seront interdits à partir d'avril et les patrons de pub devront s'assurer que de l'eau du robinet gratuite est mise à disposition des buveurs.
Le gouvernement indique que la consommation excessive d'alcool coûte jusqu'à 12 milliards de livres sterling par an à la Grande-Bretagne et a annoncé que tout pub qui enfreint le nouveau code obligatoire sera sévèrement puni. Par exemple, les patrons de pub et les vendeurs pourraient perdre leurs licences, être condamnés à une amende pouvant atteindre 20 000 livres sterling (32 750 dollars) ou à six mois de prison.

"Personne ne sait vraiment comment les anciens Égyptiens ont construit les pyramides. Mais Maureen Clemmons a une théorie. Elle pense que les Égyptiens ont peut-être utilisé des cerfs-volants.
""Si vous regardez le centre du sommet de chaque monument, vous voyez des ailes"", a déclaré Clemmons. ""Je pense que les Égyptiens ont essayé de nous le dire en images pendant 3 000 ans, c'est ainsi qu'ils ont construit les pyramides.""
Elle pense que les premiers travailleurs égyptiens auraient pu utiliser des cerfs-volants pour soulever les pierres à l'aide du vent du désert. Elle a constitué une équipe d'ingénieurs en aéronautique pour l'aider à tester sa théorie.
Hier, dans le désert de Mojave, ils ont mis leur théorie à l'épreuve en utilisant un cerf-volant en nylon, trois poulies et un obélisque pesant près de quatre tonnes. La vitesse du vent devait être juste. Et étonnamment, ça a marché.
""Il n'y a absolument aucune preuve de cerfs-volants dans l'Égypte ancienne"", a déclaré le professeur Carol Redmount de l'Université de Californie. ""Il n'y a aucune preuve de poulies telles que nous les connaissons aujourd'hui.""
Redmount dit que les preuves historiques pointent vers la ""méthode Charlton Heston"", qui repose essentiellement sur la théorie des muscles des esclaves poussant et tirant d'énormes blocs de pierre pour créer les pyramides.
Mais le groupe de levage à cerf-volant n'en veut rien savoir.
""Tout ce dont je me souviens de l'histoire, c'est que les Égyptiens buvaient de la bière au petit-déjeuner, au déjeuner et au dîner, et en tant que personne qui a fait des recherches sur le terrain sur la consommation de bière, je sais qu'après avoir bu deux bières et qu'il fait très chaud, je ne pousse ni ne tire quoi que ce soit"", a déclaré Clemmons.

"Supposons que vous deveniez un leader au sein d'une organisation. Il est très probable que vous souhaitiez avoir des bénévoles pour aider aux activités de l'organisation. Pour ce faire, il est utile de comprendre pourquoi les gens font du bénévolat et ce qui maintient leur intérêt pour ce travail.

Commençons par la question de savoir pourquoi les gens font du bénévolat. Les chercheurs ont identifié plusieurs facteurs qui motivent les gens à s'engager. Par exemple, les gens font du bénévolat pour exprimer des valeurs personnelles liées au désintéressement, pour élargir leur éventail d'expériences et pour renforcer les liens sociaux. Si les postes de bénévoles ne répondent pas à ces besoins, les gens peuvent ne pas vouloir participer. Pour sélectionner des bénévoles, vous devrez peut-être comprendre les motivations des personnes que vous souhaitez attirer.

Les gens font aussi du bénévolat parce qu'ils y sont obligés. Pour augmenter les niveaux de service communautaire, certaines écoles ont lancé des programmes de bénévolat obligatoires. Malheureusement, ces programmes peuvent faire passer le désir de participation des gens d'un facteur interne (par exemple, ""Je fais du bénévolat parce que c'est important pour moi"") à un facteur externe (par exemple, ""Je fais du bénévolat parce que je suis obligé de le faire""). Lorsque cela arrive, les gens sont moins susceptibles de faire du bénévolat à l'avenir. Les gens doivent être sensibles à cette possibilité lorsqu'ils font des activités bénévoles obligatoires.

Une fois que les gens commencent à faire du bénévolat, qu'est-ce qui les amène à rester à leur poste au fil du temps ? Pour répondre à cette question, les chercheurs ont mené des études de suivi dans lesquelles ils suivent les bénévoles au fil du temps. Par exemple, une étude a suivi 238 bénévoles en Floride pendant un an. L'un des facteurs les plus importants qui ont influencé leur satisfaction en tant que bénévoles a été la quantité de souffrance qu'ils ont vécue dans leurs postes de bénévoles. Bien que ce résultat ne vous surprenne peut-être pas, il conduit à des conseils pratiques importants. Les chercheurs notent qu'il faut accorder une attention particulière aux ""méthodes de formation qui prépareraient les bénévoles aux situations problématiques ou qui leur fourniraient des stratégies pour faire face aux problèmes qu'ils rencontrent"".

Une autre étude portant sur 302 bénévoles dans des hôpitaux de Chicago s'est concentrée sur les différences individuelles dans le degré auquel les gens considèrent ""le bénévolat"" comme un rôle social important. On a supposé que les personnes pour lesquelles le rôle de bénévole faisait le plus partie de leur identité personnelle seraient également les plus susceptibles de poursuivre leur travail bénévole. Les participants ont indiqué dans quelle mesure le rôle social était important en répondant à des affirmations telles que ""Le bénévolat à l'hôpital est une partie importante de qui je suis"". Conformément aux attentes des chercheurs, ils ont constaté une corrélation positive entre la force de l'identité du rôle et la durée pendant laquelle les gens ont continué à faire du bénévolat. Ces résultats, une fois de plus, conduisent à des conseils concrets : ""Une fois qu'une personne commence à faire du bénévolat, les efforts continus pourraient se concentrer sur le développement d'une identité de rôle de bénévole... Des éléments comme des t-shirts qui permettent aux bénévoles d'être reconnus publiquement pour leurs contributions peuvent aider à renforcer l'identité du rôle"".

"Les conditions climatiques sont délicatement ajustées à la composition de l'atmosphère terrestre. Si l'atmosphère subissait un changement, par exemple dans les quantités de gaz atmosphériques, le climat changerait probablement également. Une légère augmentation de la vapeur d'eau, par exemple, augmenterait la capacité de l'atmosphère à retenir la chaleur et entraînerait une hausse des températures mondiales.

Le niveau de dioxyde de carbone, CO2, dans l'atmosphère a un effet important sur le changement climatique. La majeure partie de l'énergie entrante de la Terre est un rayonnement à ondes courtes, qui a tendance à traverser facilement le CO2 atmosphérique. Cependant, la Terre réémet une grande partie de l'énergie reçue sous forme de rayonnement à ondes longues, que le CO2 absorbe et renvoie ensuite vers la Terre. Ce phénomène, connu sous le nom d'effet de serre, peut entraîner une augmentation de la température de surface d'une planète. Un exemple extrême de cet effet est illustré par Vénus, une planète recouverte de nuages épais composés principalement de CO2, dont les températures de surface ont été mesurées à 430 °C.

Si la teneur en CO2 de l'atmosphère diminue, la température baisse. Selon une théorie respectable, si la concentration atmosphérique de CO2 était réduite de moitié, la Terre serait entièrement recouverte de glace. Cependant, une autre théorie tout aussi respectable affirme qu'une réduction de moitié de la concentration de CO2 entraînerait seulement une réduction des températures mondiales de 3 °C.

Si, en raison d'une augmentation des incendies de forêt ou de l'activité volcanique, la teneur en CO2 de l'atmosphère augmentait, un climat plus chaud serait produit. La croissance des plantes, qui dépend à la fois de la chaleur et de la disponibilité du CO2, augmenterait probablement. En conséquence, les plantes utiliseraient de plus en plus de CO2. Finalement, les niveaux de CO2 diminueraient et le climat, à son tour, deviendrait plus frais. Avec la baisse des températures, de nombreuses plantes mourraient ; le CO2 serait alors renvoyé dans l'atmosphère et la température augmenterait progressivement à nouveau. Ainsi, si ce processus se produisait, il pourrait y avoir une oscillation à long terme de la quantité de CO2 présente dans l'atmosphère, avec des augmentations et des diminutions régulières de la température.

Certains climatologues soutiennent que la combustion des combustibles fossiles a fait augmenter le niveau de CO2 dans l'atmosphère et a entraîné une augmentation de la température mondiale d'au moins 1 °C. Mais une prétendue augmentation de la température mondiale de 1 °C peut en réalité n'être que plusieurs augmentations de température régionales, limitées aux zones où il existe de nombreuses stations météorologiques. D'autres zones, par exemple la zone océanique de l'hémisphère sud, peuvent connaître une baisse de température équivalente qui n'est pas reconnue en raison du manque de stations d'enregistrement météorologiques.

"Dans un monde idéal, les gens ne testeraient pas les médicaments sur les animaux. Ces expériences sont stressantes et parfois douloureuses pour les animaux, et coûteuses et chronophages pour les humains. Pourtant, l'expérimentation animale est toujours nécessaire pour combler de vastes lacunes dans les connaissances médicales. C'est pourquoi environ 50 à 100 millions d'animaux sont utilisés dans la recherche dans le monde chaque année.

L'Europe, dans l'ensemble, a les lois les plus restrictives au monde sur les expériences animales. Malgré cela, ses scientifiques utilisent environ 12 millions d'animaux par an, principalement des souris et des rats, pour la recherche médicale. Les statistiques officielles montrent que seulement 1,1 million d'animaux sont utilisés dans la recherche en Amérique chaque année. Mais c'est trompeur. Les autorités américaines ne pensent pas que les souris et les rats valent la peine d'être comptés et, comme ce sont les animaux de laboratoire les plus courants, le chiffre réel est beaucoup plus élevé. Le Japon et la Chine ont des données encore moins complètes que l'Amérique.

L'Europe est maintenant en train de réformer les règles régissant les expériences animales en limitant le nombre d'animaux utilisés dans les laboratoires. Des alternatives à l'expérimentation animale, telles que l'utilisation de tissus humains ou de modèles informatiques, sont maintenant fortement recommandées. En outre, le partage de tous les résultats de recherche librement devrait contribuer à réduire le nombre d'animaux utilisés à des fins scientifiques. À l'heure actuelle, les scientifiques ne partagent souvent que les résultats des expériences réussies. Si leurs conclusions ne correspondent pas à l'hypothèse testée, le travail ne voit jamais le jour. Cette pratique signifie gaspiller du temps, de l'argent et des vies animales en répétant sans cesse les expériences infructueuses.

L'expérimentation animale a beaucoup appris à l'humanité et a sauvé d'innombrables vies. Elle doit continuer, même si cela signifie que les animaux souffrent parfois. Les nouvelles mesures européennes devraient à terme à la fois réduire le nombre d'animaux utilisés dans les expériences et améliorer la manière dont la recherche scientifique est menée.

"""Docteur Papaderos, quel est le sens de la vie ?""
Le rire habituel suivit, et les gens commencèrent à se lever pour partir. Le docteur Papaderos leva les mains, calma la salle et me regarda longuement, demandant du regard si j'étais sérieux et voyant dans mes yeux que j'étais sérieux.
""Je vais répondre à votre question.""
Prenant son portefeuille de sa poche arrière, il fouilla dans un portefeuille en cuir et en sortit un tout petit miroir rond, à peu près de la taille d'une pièce de 25 cents. Et ce qu'il dit ressemblait à ceci : ""Quand j'étais un petit enfant pendant la guerre, nous étions très pauvres et nous vivions dans un village isolé. Un jour, sur la route, j'ai trouvé des morceaux de miroir cassés. Une moto allemande avait été détruite à cet endroit.
J'ai essayé de retrouver tous les morceaux et de les assembler, mais ce n'était pas possible, alors j'ai gardé seulement le plus gros morceau. Celui-ci. et, en le grattant sur une pierre, je l'ai rendu rond. J'ai commencé à jouer avec comme un jouet et j'ai été fasciné par le fait que je pouvais réfléchir la lumière dans les endroits sombres où le soleil ne brillait jamais - dans les trous profonds et les crevasses et les placards sombres. C'est devenu un jeu pour moi de faire entrer la lumière dans les endroits les plus inaccessibles que je pouvais trouver.
J'ai gardé le petit miroir, et, au fil de ma croissance, je le sortais pendant mon temps libre et continuais le défi du jeu. En devenant un homme, j'ai compris que ce n'était pas seulement un jeu d'enfant mais une métaphore de ce que je pouvais faire de ma vie. J'ai compris que je n'étais pas la lumière ou la source de la lumière. Mais la lumière - la vérité, la compréhension, la connaissance - est là, et elle brillera dans de nombreux endroits sombres seulement si je la réfléchis.
Je suis un fragment d'un miroir dont je ne connais ni la forme ni la forme entière. Néanmoins, avec ce que j'ai, je peux réfléchir la lumière dans les endroits sombres de ce monde - dans les endroits noirs du cœur des hommes - et changer certaines choses chez certaines personnes. Peut-être que d'autres verront et feront de même. C'est de cela que je parle. C'est le sens de ma vie.""

"Beaucoup de jeunes me disent vouloir être écrivain. J'encourage toujours ces personnes, mais j'explique aussi qu'il y a une grande différence entre ""être écrivain"" et écrire. Dans la plupart des cas, ces personnes rêvent de richesse et de gloire, pas des longues heures passées seul à une machine à écrire. ""Il faut vouloir écrire,"" je leur dis, ""pas vouloir être écrivain.""

La réalité est que l'écriture est une affaire solitaire, privée et mal payée. Pour chaque écrivain embrassé par la fortune, il y en a des milliers d'autres dont le désir n'est jamais récompensé. Quand j'ai quitté une carrière de 20 ans dans la Garde côtière américaine pour devenir écrivain indépendant, je n'avais absolument aucun espoir. Ce que j'avais, c'était un ami qui m'a trouvé une chambre dans un immeuble à New York. Peu importait qu'elle soit froide et sans salle de bain. J'ai immédiatement acheté une machine à écrire d'occasion et je me suis senti comme un véritable écrivain.

Après un an ou deux, cependant, je n'avais toujours pas eu de chance et j'ai commencé à douter de moi-même. Il était si difficile de vendre une histoire que j'avais à peine de quoi manger. Mais je savais que je voulais écrire, j'en rêvais depuis des années. Je n'allais pas être l'un de ceux qui abandonnent - j'allais continuer à mettre mon rêve à l'épreuve, même si cela signifiait vivre avec l'incertitude et la peur de l'échec. C'est le royaume de l'espoir, et toute personne ayant un rêve doit apprendre à y vivre.

"Apprendre à jouer d'un instrument de musique peut modifier votre cerveau, une étude américaine ayant révélé que la formation musicale peut améliorer les compétences en matière de parole et de langues étrangères.

Bien qu'il ait été suggéré par le passé que l'écoute de la musique de Mozart ou d'autres musiques classiques pouvait rendre plus intelligent, il y a peu de preuves pour montrer que la musique peut stimuler la puissance cérébrale.

Mais une revue basée sur des données de la Northwestern University a regroupé des recherches qui relient la formation musicale à un apprentissage qui déborde sur des compétences telles que le langage, la parole, la mémoire, l'attention et même l'émotion vocale.

La chercheuse Nina Kraus a déclaré que les données suggéraient fortement que les connexions nerveuses établies pendant la formation musicale préparaient également le cerveau à d'autres aspects de la communication humaine.

""L'effet de la formation musicale suggère que, comme l'exercice physique et son effet sur la forme physique, la musique est une ressource qui tonifie le cerveau pour la *forme physique* et nécessite donc que la société réexamine le rôle de la musique dans la formation du développement individuel"", ont déclaré les chercheurs dans leur étude.

Kraus a déclaré que l'apprentissage des sons musicaux pouvait améliorer la capacité du cerveau à s'adapter et à changer, et permettre également au système nerveux de fournir des modèles de construction qui sont importants pour l'apprentissage.

L'étude, publiée dans Nature Review Neuroscience, a examiné l'explosion de recherches ces dernières années qui se concentrent sur l'effet de la formation musicale sur le système nerveux, qui pourrait avoir des impacts sur l'éducation.

L'étude a révélé que jouer d'un instrument prépare le cerveau à choisir ce qui est lié dans un processus complexe qui peut impliquer la lecture ou la mémorisation d'une partition, des problèmes de timing et la coordination avec d'autres musiciens.

"Imaginez faire vos achats de vêtements en ligne et pouvoir passer la main sur l'écran de votre ordinateur ou de votre smartphone pour sentir les matières. Ce type de technologie de simulation pourrait être disponible d'ici cinq ans.
""Nous parlons de réinventer la façon dont les ordinateurs interagissent avec les humains"", a déclaré Bernie Meyerson, vice-président d'IBM. L'extension de notre sens du toucher est l'une des innovations qu'IBM croit changer le monde dans les cinq prochaines années, selon la liste annuelle ""Five in Five"" de la société.
Les machines intelligentes seront également capables d'écouter l'environnement et de mettre en évidence les sons qui nous intéressent le plus. Par exemple, un système avancé de reconnaissance vocale indiquera aux nouveaux parents pourquoi leur bébé pleure. Ce genre de chose n'est pas possible aujourd'hui, mais avec un système suffisamment avancé, c'est effectivement possible.
Dans un avenir proche, les ordinateurs personnels seront capables de faire plus que de reconnaître des images et des données visuelles. Leurs caméras intégrées seront capables d'analyser des caractéristiques telles que les couleurs, et de comprendre le sens des médias visuels, par exemple en sachant comment trier des photos de famille.
Les machines intelligentes seront également capables de sentir. Si vous éternuez sur votre ordinateur ou votre téléphone portable, de minuscules capteurs dans la machine seront capables d'analyser des milliers de molécules dans votre souffle. ""Cela peut vous donner une alarme et vous dire : 'Hé, vous êtes probablement malade, allez voir votre médecin immédiatement'"", explique Meyerson.
Mark Maloo est professeur d'informatique à l'université de Georgetown. Il espère que ces progrès encourageront davantage d'étudiants à étudier les sciences, la technologie, l'ingénierie et les mathématiques, les préparant à jouer un rôle dans les innovations futures. Il croit qu'il ne fait aucun doute que les progrès de la technologie informatique au cours des cinq prochaines années feront de ce qui semble aujourd'hui de la science-fiction une partie de notre vie quotidienne.

"Les enfants peuvent passer des heures par jour à regarder des écrans d'ordinateur et autres appareils numériques. Certains ophtalmologistes affirment que cela conduit à une augmentation du ""syndrome de la vision informatique"".

Nathan Bonilla-Warford est un optométriste à Tampa, en Floride. Il a constaté une augmentation des problèmes chez les enfants. ""Beaucoup plus d'enfants viennent au cabinet soit parce que leurs parents ont remarqué qu'ils avaient des maux de tête, des yeux rouges ou larmoyants ou un inconfort, soit parce que leur myopie semble augmenter et qu'ils sont inquiets"", dit-il.

Le Dr Bonilla-Warford affirme qu'une partie du problème est que les enfants sont peut-être plus susceptibles de ne pas prêter attention aux signes avant-coureurs que les adultes. ""Même si leurs yeux commencent à se sentir mal à l'aise ou s'ils commencent à avoir mal à la tête, ils sont moins susceptibles d'en parler à leurs parents, car ils ne veulent pas que le jeu, l'ordinateur ou quoi que ce soit leur soit retiré"", explique-t-il.

Il explique qu'une autre partie du problème est que les gens clignement moins souvent lorsqu'ils utilisent des appareils numériques. Il dit : ""Une personne qui utilise un appareil électronique cligne environ un tiers moins souvent que nous le faisons normalement dans la vie de tous les jours. Et cela peut entraîner un assèchement de la partie antérieure de l'œil et une absence de protection normale.""

Les ophtalmologistes offrent des suggestions comme la règle 20/20/20. Cela signifie que toutes les vingt minutes, il faut détourner le regard pendant au moins vingt secondes de l'appareil que vous utilisez, en regardant à vingt pieds ou plus.

D'autres suggestions incluent d'augmenter la distance entre vous et l'appareil et d'utiliser un bon éclairage. Bien sûr, une autre façon est de passer moins de temps à regarder des écrans. De nombreux experts affirment que les enfants ne devraient pas passer plus de deux heures par jour à utiliser des appareils numériques, et qu'il ne devrait pas y avoir de temps d'écran pour les enfants de moins de deux ans.

Mais tous les ophtalmologistes n'ont pas constaté une augmentation des problèmes chez les enfants. Le Dr David Hunter, de l'hôpital pour enfants de Boston, n'a pas constaté d'augmentation dans sa pratique. ""S'il est possible de développer des problèmes en regardant des écrans pendant une longue période, il n'y a certainement aucune preuve que cela cause des dommages aux yeux"", dit-il.

"Evan Green, un garçon de onze ans, ne veut pas sauver un seul arbre, il veut sauver toute une forêt tropicale !
Dans la ville de Redwood City, en Californie, un garçon a créé un groupe appelé Red Dragon Conservation Team il y a quatre ans pour y parvenir. Jusqu’à présent, les membres de l’équipe ont collecté 4 500 $. Cela suffit à acheter et à protéger plus de 16 acres de forêt tropicale au Costa Rica par le biais du Center for Ecosystem Survival.
Chaque année, des milliers de kilomètres carrés de forêts tropicales sont détruits dans le monde entier. L’exploitation forestière et l’agriculture sont les principales causes de cette destruction, selon les scientifiques. Cette perte est une terrible nouvelle pour les animaux et les hommes. Même si les forêts tropicales ne couvrent que moins de 2 % de la surface de la Terre, elles abritent la moitié des plantes et des animaux de la planète. Les forêts tropicales fournissent également de l’eau et aident à réguler le climat de la Terre.
Le travail d’Evan pour sauver les forêts tropicales lui a valu récemment un prix Barron pour les jeunes héros. Ces prix sont décernés aux enfants ou aux adolescents qui ont eu un impact positif sur le monde. L’objectif d’Evan est de « sauver suffisamment de forêts tropicales pour qu’elles durent éternellement ». Il ne devra pas le faire seul. Ses actions ont déjà inspiré d’autres enfants à apporter leur contribution. Une fille a demandé des dons au lieu de cadeaux pour son anniversaire. Elle a récolté 850 $. D’autres enfants créent leurs propres équipes de conservation.
Evan affirme que chacun peut aider la planète, même en prenant de petites mesures, comme le recyclage. Lui et sa famille s’efforcent de faire la différence chaque jour. « Nous recyclons, nous essayons de limiter nos déchets… nous marchons un peu plus et nous achetons des produits locaux », a déclaré Evan.

"Rocky Lyons avait cinq ans lorsque sa mère, Kelly, conduisait avec lui sur une route de campagne. Il dormait sur le siège avant de leur camion, les pieds posés sur ses genoux. Alors que sa mère conduisait prudemment sur la route sinueuse, elle tourna sur un pont étroit. Le camion a heurté un rocher et a glissé hors de la route. Elle a tenté de le ramener sur la route en appuyant fortement sur l'accélérateur et en tournant le volant à gauche. Mais le pied de Rocky s'est coincé entre sa jambe et le volant et elle a perdu le contrôle du camion. 

Le camion est tombé dans un ravin de 20 pieds. Lorsqu'il a touché le fond, Rocky s'est réveillé. ""Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé, maman ?"" demanda-t-il. ""Nos roues pointent vers le ciel.""

Kelly était gravement blessée et aveuglée par le sang. ""Je vais te sortir, maman"", annonça Rocky, qui avait étonnamment échappé à toute blessure. Il est sorti de dessous Kelly, a glissé par la fenêtre ouverte et a essayé de _ sortir sa mère. Mais elle n'a pas bougé.

""Laisse-moi juste dormir"", supplia Kelly, qui avait perdu connaissance. Rocky insista : ""Maman, tu ne peux pas t'endormir.""

Rocky a réussi à pousser Kelly hors du camion et lui a dit qu'il allait grimper jusqu'à la route et arrêter une voiture pour obtenir de l'aide. Craignant que personne ne puisse voir son petit garçon dans l'obscurité, Kelly a refusé de le laisser partir seul. Au lieu de cela, ils ont lentement remonté la route. La douleur était si forte que Kelly voulait abandonner, mais Rocky ne la laissait pas faire.

Rocky répétait sans cesse la phrase inspirante : ""Je sais que tu peux, je sais que tu peux."" Lorsqu'ils ont finalement atteint la route, Rocky a fondu en larmes en voyant le visage déchiré de sa mère pour la première fois. Agitant les bras et criant : ""S'il vous plaît, arrêtez-vous !"" le garçon a arrêté un camion. Sa mère a été envoyée à l'hôpital.

Il a fallu 8 heures pour reconstruire le visage de Kelly. Elle a l'air assez différente aujourd'hui - ""J'avais un nez long et droit, des lèvres fines et des pommettes hautes ; maintenant j'ai des joues plates et des lèvres beaucoup plus grosses"" - mais elle a peu de cicatrices et s'est remise de ses blessures.

"Dans de nombreuses sociétés, la peau claire est souvent plus acceptée que la peau foncée ; la peau claire peut être considérée comme un signe de beauté, d'intelligence et de réussite. Ces croyances peuvent engendrer des pressions sociales même au sein d'un même groupe, si certains membres sont plus foncés que d'autres.
En conséquence, l'éclaircissement de la peau est devenu très répandu en Afrique, en Asie et dans d'autres régions du monde, et de plus en plus de personnes à la peau foncée utilisent des produits éclaircissants, même si cela signifie qu'elles risquent leur santé. Elles croient qu'avoir une peau plus claire améliorera la qualité de leur vie. Beaucoup de gens pensent qu'ils auront une meilleure famille. Ou ils veulent ressembler à ce que leur société considère généralement comme beau.
Certains produits de beauté et savons contiennent des produits chimiques qui éclaircissent la peau. Cependant, certains de ces produits chimiques sont extrêmement dangereux. Les produits chimiques contenus dans les produits bloquent et décomposent la barrière naturelle qui protège du soleil. La peau peut alors devenir épaisse et décolorée. En général, la personne utilisera plus de produit pour tenter de corriger le problème, ce qui ne fera qu'aggraver les choses. Le docteur Ly affirme que certains produits chimiques sont si dangereux qu'ils peuvent entraîner un noircissement des ongles, des infections et de graves dommages cutanés.
Et ce ne sont pas les seuls problèmes. Les experts affirment que certaines personnes qui changent de couleur de peau subissent des dommages émotionnels.

"La plupart des animaux protègent leurs petits jusqu'à ce qu'ils soient assez grands pour prendre soin d'eux-mêmes. Un poisson qui nage dans les rivières d'Amérique du Sud protège ses petits d'une manière très étrange. Ce poisson, une sorte de poisson-chat, utilise sa bouche pour mettre ses bébés à l'abri du danger.
Lorsque ce poisson-chat pond ses œufs, il les porte dans sa bouche. D'après ce que nous savons, il ne se nourrit pas pendant cette période. Une fois les œufs éclos, le poisson nage avec ses petits pour les protéger. Il ouvre sa bouche lorsque le danger apparaît, et les minuscules poissons nagent à l'intérieur.

"Une étude de l'Université de Saint-Louis a révélé qu'un chien adorable nommé Sparky et un chien robotique, AIBO, étaient à peu près aussi efficaces pour réduire la solitude des résidents de maisons de retraite. L'étude a confirmé les conclusions antérieures selon lesquelles les chiens ont un bon effet sur les résidents de maisons de retraite.
Le Dr Andrew Smith a dirigé l'équipe de l'Université de Stanford qui a construit un robot d'assistance à domicile. ""Si les humains peuvent ressentir un lien émotionnel avec les robots, un jour ils pourraient être non seulement nos assistants, mais aussi nos compagnons"", a-t-il déclaré.
Pour tester si les résidents répondaient mieux à Sparky, un chien dressé, ou au chien robotique fabriqué par Sony, les chercheurs ont divisé 38 résidents de maisons de retraite en trois groupes dans trois centres de soins de longue durée à Saint-Louis.
Un groupe a eu des visites hebdomadaires individuelles de 30 minutes avec Sparky ; un autre groupe a eu des visites similaires avec AIBO ; un groupe témoin n'a eu aucun contact avec l'un ou l'autre des chiens. Les niveaux de solitude respectifs des groupes ont été testés en leur faisant répondre à un certain nombre de questions au début et vers la fin des visites.
Après deux mois, les deux groupes qui avaient eu des contacts avec les chiens étaient moins seuls et plus attachés. La plupart des personnes âgées considéraient Sparky, un chien de 9 ans, comme un public pour leurs histoires de vie, a déclaré l'investigatrice Marian Banks.
""Il écoutait attentivement, remuait la queue et leur permettait de le caresser"", a déclaré Banks, qui a adopté et dressé Sparky après l'avoir trouvé dans une rue derrière sa maison il y a sept ans.
Ceux qui étaient ensemble avec AIBO ont mis un peu plus de temps à se familiariser avec la créature robotique. Au fil du temps, cependant, ils se sont mis à l'aise avec lui, et l'ont caressé et lui ont parlé. Il répondait en remuant la queue, en émettant des sons et en clignotant de ses lumières.
""AIBO est charmant une fois que vous commencez à interagir avec lui"", a déclaré l'auteur de l'étude, le Dr William Banks, ""C'est un type attrayant. Il donne l'impression d'être personnel, pas seulement un robot.""

"  Alors que Warren Buffet, âgé de 7 ans, déclarait ""Je serai l'homme le plus riche un jour"", ses amis se moquaient de ses ""rêvasseries"". Mais depuis, le petit garçon s'est lancé dans l'apprentissage de la façon de gagner de l'argent, vendant des boissons, livrant des journaux et achetant des actions. Il avait déjà gagné 9 000 $ (l'équivalent de 90 000 $ aujourd'hui) au moment où il a obtenu son diplôme d'études secondaires et est devenu millionnaire à 32 ans.
Et ce mois-ci, l'homme de 77 ans, qui a fait fortune en réalisant de nombreux investissements judicieux sur le marché boursier, a réalisé son rêve d'enfance. Avec une fortune de 62 milliards de dollars, Buffet est devenu l'homme le plus riche du monde selon le magazine Forbes.
Né en 1930, Buffet, fils unique d'un courtier en bourse, a commencé à réaliser son rêve de milliardaire dès son plus jeune âge et était toujours prêt à sortir des sentiers battus pour développer son entreprise. À 8 ans, il allait sur les terrains de golf pour ramasser et vendre des balles usagées.
À 11 ans, lorsqu'il vendait du soda de porte en porte avec un ami, le duo ramassait des capsules dans la rue pour déterminer quelle saveur était la plus populaire.
En tant que livreur de journaux pendant ses études secondaires, Buffet livrait deux journaux rivaux, afin que même lorsque les clients annulaient l'un des abonnements, il puisse toujours réaliser un profit grâce à l'autre. Avec les économies de sa livraison de journaux, Buffet a acheté 162 000 mètres carrés de terres agricoles et a perçu des loyers.
Le jeune Buffet s'est lancé sur le marché boursier à 11 ans, mais n'a gagné que 5 $. L'expérience lui a appris l'une des vertus de l'investissement : la patience.
Après avoir obtenu son diplôme universitaire, Buffet a lancé son aventure boursière avec ses gains d'enfance et l'argent de ses amis. Il a fait des recherches sur les actions et n'a acheté que celles de sociétés solides qui étaient sous-évaluées et bon marché à l'époque. En restant fidèle à des sociétés comme American Express et Coca-Cola, Buffet est devenu riche.
""L'apprentissage est important pour le succès de Buffet. C'est une machine à apprendre qui peut passer toute sa journée à lire. Il continue d'apprendre, des livres, de la débrouillardise et de l'investigation, tant des réussites que des échecs. De cette façon, il a finalement dépassé ses capacités ( )"", a déclaré Charlie Munger, son partenaire commercial de longue date.

"C'était un soir glacial dans le nord de la Virginie, il y a de nombreuses années. La barbe du vieil homme était glacée par le givre hivernal tandis qu'il attendait un passage de l'autre côté de la rivière. L'attente semblait interminable. Son corps devint engourdi et raide sous l'effet du vent glacial du nord.

Longtemps après, il entendit le rythme faible et régulier des sabots sur le chemin gelé. Observant anxieusement plusieurs cavaliers s'approcher, il laissa le premier passer sans effort pour attirer son attention, puis un autre passa, puis un autre encore. Finalement, le dernier cavalier s'approcha de l'endroit où le vieil homme était assis comme une statue de neige lorsqu'il croisa son regard et dit : ""Monsieur, pourriez-vous bien me donner un passage de l'autre côté ?""

Arrêtant son cheval, le cavalier répondit : ""Bien sûr ! Montez à bord."" Voyant que le vieil homme était incapable de soulever son corps à moitié gelé du sol, le cavalier descendit pour l'aider. Le cavalier l'emmena non seulement de l'autre côté de la rivière, mais jusqu'à sa destination, à quelques kilomètres de là.

Alors qu'ils approchaient de la minuscule mais confortable chaumière, la curiosité du cavalier le poussa à demander : ""Monsieur, j'ai remarqué que vous avez laissé plusieurs autres cavaliers passer sans faire d'effort pour obtenir un passage. Puis je suis arrivé et vous m'avez immédiatement demandé un passage. Je suis curieux de savoir pourquoi, par une nuit aussi glaciale, vous avez attendu et demandé au dernier cavalier. Et si j'avais refusé et vous avais laissé ici ?""

Le vieil homme regarda le cavalier droit dans les yeux et répondit : ""Je crois connaître les gens assez bien. J'ai regardé dans les yeux des autres cavaliers et n'ai immédiatement trouvé aucune préoccupation pour ma situation. Il aurait été inutile même de leur demander un passage. Mais lorsque j'ai regardé dans vos yeux, votre esprit doux accueillerait l'occasion de me donner de l'aide dans mon moment de besoin.""

Ces commentaires chaleureux ont profondément touché le cavalier. ""Je suis tellement reconnaissant pour ce que vous avez dit,"" dit-il au vieil homme. ""Puisse-je ne jamais être trop occupé dans mes propres affaires pour ne pas répondre aux besoins des autres avec gentillesse et compassion.""

"Avez-vous déjà vu un cheval avec des orteils ? Il y a des millions d'années, les chevaux avaient de nombreux orteils. Ils avaient quatre orteils à chaque patte avant. Ils avaient trois orteils à chaque patte arrière. Les chevaux n'étaient pas plus gros que les chats. Ces petits chevaux vivaient dans la forêt. Les orteils aidaient les chevaux à courir sur le sol mou et humide.
Au début, il faisait très chaud dans la forêt. Mais le temps a changé. Il est devenu très froid. De nombreux arbres n'ont pas pu survivre au froid. Les arbres sont morts et sont tombés. Des champs ouverts ont pris la place des forêts. Le soleil a rendu le sol sec et dur.
Les chevaux ont aussi commencé à changer. Ils ont commencé à grandir. Cela a pris beaucoup de temps. Sur le sol sec et dur, les chevaux n'avaient besoin que de leurs orteils du milieu pour courir.

"Aujourd'hui, nous avons le deuxième rapport expliquant comment préparer le poisson en le séchant ou en le fumant. La semaine dernière, nous avons parlé des premières étapes du nettoyage et du salage du poisson fraîchement pêché.

Pour sécher le poisson, vous aurez besoin d'une table de séchage ou d'un endroit où l'accrocher. Si vous utilisez une table, elle doit avoir un dessus en treillis métallique ou en fines pièces de bois avec un espace entre chaque pièce.

Posez le poisson nettoyé, salé et humide sur le dessus de la table. Ne les laissez pas se toucher. Assurez-vous que l'air peut atteindre le poisson de tous les côtés. 

Retournez le poisson tous les deux jours. Les petits poissons sècheront en environ trois jours si l'air est sec. Les gros poissons mettront une semaine ou dix jours à sécher.

Une fois les poissons séchés, placez-les dans un panier. Couvrez-les de papier propre ou de grandes feuilles. Ensuite, placez le panier dans un endroit frais et sec hors du sol.

Assurez-vous que la plus grande partie de l'eau salée est éliminée avant de fumer le poisson.

La fumée peut être effectuée dans un grand récipient métallique rond. Retirez le dessus du tambour et coupez une petite ouverture sur un côté en bas.

Couvrez le dessus d'un treillis métallique solide, où vous placez le poisson. Allumez un petit feu dans le tambour en passant par l'ouverture en bas.

Le bois des arbres fruitiers est un bon combustible pour votre feu.  _ donnera au poisson fumé une bonne couleur et un bon goût. Une façon d'obtenir beaucoup de fumée est d'utiliser du bois vert, et non du bois sec.

Vous devriez fumer le poisson pendant cinq jours ou plus si vous prévoyez de le conserver pendant une longue période. Ensuite, enveloppez-le dans du papier propre, mettez le poisson dans des paniers et conservez-le dans un endroit frais et sec hors du sol.

"En tant que responsable, Tiffany est chargée d'interviewer les candidats pour certains postes au sein de son entreprise. Lors d'un entretien, elle a remarqué que le candidat n'établissait jamais de contact visuel direct. Elle était perplexe et quelque peu déçue, car elle aimait l'individu par ailleurs. Il avait un CV parfait et a donné de bonnes réponses à ses questions, mais le fait qu'il ne la regardait jamais dans les yeux disait ""non fiable"", alors elle a décidé d'offrir le poste à son deuxième choix. ""Ce n'est que lorsque j'ai participé à un atelier sur la diversité que j'ai réalisé que la personne que nous avions écartée était la personne idéale."" admet Tiffany. Ce qu'elle ne savait pas au moment de l'entretien, c'est que le comportement ""différent"" du candidat n'était qu'un malentendu culturel. C'était un Américain d'origine asiatique élevé dans une famille où le respect de l'autorité se manifestait en détournant les yeux. ""J'ai été simplement décontenancée par l'absence de contact visuel, sans réaliser que c'était culturel"", dit Tiffany. ""J'ai manqué une opportunité, mais je ne manquerai plus cette chance.""
Beaucoup d'entre nous ont vécu des expériences similaires avec des comportements que nous décrivons comme différents. Alors que le monde se réduit et que nos lieux de travail deviennent plus diversifiés, il devient essentiel d'élargir notre compréhension des autres et de réexaminer certaines de nos fausses suppositions.
Avantage du recrutement
À une époque où il devient de plus en plus difficile de recruter des personnes qualifiées, les employeurs qui peuvent supprimer tout biais personnel du processus ont un avantage évident. Mon entreprise, Mindsets LLC, aide les organisations et les particuliers à identifier leurs propres angles morts. Un agent immobilier avec lequel nous avons travaillé illustre la différence positive que cette formation peut apporter.
""Pendant ma période de coaching chez Mindsets, j'ai appris à posséder une main-d'œuvre diversifiée. J'ai employé des personnes de cultures et de compétences différentes. Les agents ont pu utiliser pleinement leur potentiel et leurs expériences pour développer l'entreprise. Lorsque le marché immobilier a commencé à changer, c'est parce que nous avions un bassin d'agents diversifié que nous avons pu rester sur le marché immobilier beaucoup plus longtemps que les autres dans la même profession.""
Aveuglé par le sexe
Dale est un directeur de compte qui a assisté à l'un de mes ateliers en charge d'une main-d'œuvre diversifiée. ""Grâce à certaines leçons, j'ai découvert mon propre biais personnel."" se souvient-il. ""J'ai appris que je n'avais pas considéré une personne comme une personne entière, et que j'étais ouvert aux différences."" Dans son cas, l'aveuglement ne portait pas sur la culture, mais plutôt sur le sexe.
""J'avais un poste de direction à pourvoir dans mon département ; et les deux finalistes étaient un homme et une femme. Si je n'avais pas assisté à cet atelier, j'aurais automatiquement supposé que l'homme était le meilleur candidat car le poste nécessitait pas mal de déplacements. J'aurais supposé que même si les deux candidats étaient excellents et auraient pu réussir à ce poste, j'aurais supposé que la femme aurait voulu être à la maison avec ses enfants et ne pas voyager."" Les suppositions de Dale sont un autre exemple de la pensée bien intentionnée mais incorrecte qui limite la capacité d'une organisation à promouvoir le plein potentiel d'une main-d'œuvre diversifiée. ""J'ai appris en cours qu'au lieu de forcer mes préjugés sexistes dans la situation, j'avais besoin de présenter l'ensemble des fonctions, responsabilités et attentes à tous les candidats et de leur permettre de prendre une décision éclairée."" Dale fait l'éloge de l'atelier, ""parce qu'il m'a aidé à prendre des décisions basées sur l'équité.""
Une meilleure rentabilité
Un esprit ouvert sur la diversité améliore non seulement les organisations de l'intérieur, mais est également rentable. Ces commentaires d'un représentant du service client montrent comment une attitude inclusive peut améliorer les ventes."" La plupart de mes clients parlent anglais comme langue seconde. L'une des meilleures choses que mon entreprise a faites est de passer un contrat avec un service de traduction qui propose des traductions par téléphone. Ce n'est que lorsque mon patron a reçu la formation de Mindsets qu'elle a pu comprendre à quel point l'inclusivité était importante pour le service client. En conséquence, notre clientèle a augmenté.""
Une fois que nous commençons à voir les gens comme des individus, nous pouvons avancer positivement vers l'inclusivité pour tous. La diversité consiste à se rassembler et à tirer parti de nos différences et de nos similitudes, ainsi qu'à construire de meilleures communautés et organisations. Lorsque nous commençons à remettre en question nos suppositions et à contester ce que nous pensons avoir appris de notre passé, des médias, de nos pairs, de notre famille, de nos amis, etc., nous commençons à réaliser que certaines de nos conclusions sont imparfaites ou contraires à nos valeurs fondamentales. Nous devons nous entraîner à penser différemment, à changer notre état d'esprit et à réaliser que la diversité ouvre des portes à tous, créant des opportunités dans les organisations et les communautés qui profitent à tous.

"Lorsque la famille Farnsworth a déménagé dans sa nouvelle ferme en 1919, Philo, âgé de onze ans, a été surpris de la trouver câblée pour l'électricité. Cette circonstance inhabituelle a contribué à son destin - devenir un inventeur important du XXe siècle.

A treize ans, Farnsworth était devenu un ingénieur électricien autodidacte. Il était capable de réparer le générateur de la ferme alors qu'aucun des adultes ne le pouvait. En 1922, il a lu un article sur une nouvelle idée de John Baird, un scientifique écossais, qui avait travaillé avec le tube cathodique pour la transmission d'images électroniques et voulait l'essayer lui-même.

Farnsworth a étudié tout ce qu'il pouvait trouver sur le sujet. Bien que de nombreux ingénieurs plus âgés avec des soutiens financiers développaient déjà la télévision, Farnsworth a pris une décision audacieuse - il allait perfectionner un modèle fonctionnel avant tout le monde.

Au collège, Farnsworth a poursuivi ses recherches avec les tubes cathodiques et à vide, mais la mort de son père, le seul gagne-pain de la famille, l'a obligé à abandonner ces recherches et à trouver un emploi. Son premier emploi était chez George Everson, avec qui Farnsworth a discuté de son rêve de télévision. Tout en reconnaissant les réalisations de ceux qui l'ont précédé, Farnsworth pensait pouvoir aller plus loin. Everson a accepté de risquer 6 000 $ pour la recherche.

Des bailleurs de fonds sont arrivés en 1927 pour voir la première télévision américaine, un an après celle de Baird. Ils ont été étonnés de voir l'image d'une seule ligne blanche se résoudre sur l'écran devant eux, et ont convenu que cette nouvelle invention valait la peine d'y investir de l'argent.

En 1930, Farnsworth a obtenu un brevet pour sa télévision entièrement électronique. Au moment de sa mort, il avait obtenu plus de 300 brevets américains et étrangers pour des dispositifs électroniques et mécaniques.

"Il est 4 heures du matin. Tout, sauf la salle informatique du campus de l'université, semble aussi silencieux et brumeux que l'enfer mystérieux. Dans la salle informatique, 30 étudiants aux yeux endormis sont assis immobile à leurs bureaux, frappant sur les touches sales et usées. Fixant l'écran coloré, ils tapent sans cesse pendant des heures. Pour d'autres parties du monde, il pourrait être au milieu de la nuit, mais ici, le temps ne représente rien. C'est un champ entièrement clos. Ces jeunes ""hackers"" informatiques tracent une sorte de stimulus, un moteur si excitant et absorbant qu'il ignore presque tout le reste dans leur vie et devient le centre de leur être. Ils sont des programmeurs informatiques accros. Certains de ces étudiants sont restés collés à la console pendant pas moins de vingt heures, sans même une pause pour les repas ou le repos. Certains dormaient sur des canapés et des chaises dans la salle informatique, essayant de lutter pour quelques instants de repos, mais détestant s'éloigner trop de leurs machines addictives.

Il n'est pas nécessaire pour la plupart de ces étudiants d'être dans la salle informatique au milieu de la nuit. Ce sur quoi ils travaillent n'appartient à aucun devoir. Ils restent là parce qu'ils le désirent - ils ne peuvent pas résister à l'attrait des ordinateurs.

De plus, ils sont en groupes au lieu d'être seuls. Il y a des hackers dans les salles informatiques partout au pays. D'une manière inimaginable, ils ne se concentrent que sur l'ordinateur. Ils échappent aux études et vivent au-delà de l'amitié ; ils peuvent avoir des difficultés à être employés, choisissant de voyager d'une salle informatique à l'autre. Ils peuvent même abandonner leur santé personnelle.

""Il y a un hacker dans ma mémoire. Nous avons dû l'enlever de sa chaise pour le nourrir, l'organiser pour se reposer et dormir. Nous nous sommes vraiment inquiétés pour sa santé"", dit un professeur d'informatique à l'université de Californie.

Les professeurs d'informatique accordent de plus en plus d'attention à ce phénomène de hacker et surveillent les futurs hackers et les accros à l'informatique de plus en plus sévères.

"Les écureuils communiquent souvent à l'aide de sifflements, de gazouillis et de ""chucks"", qui ressemblent au mot ""chuck"". Les sifflements et les gazouillis ressemblent aux sons que produisent de nombreux oiseaux. Maintenant, les scientifiques ont traduit une partie de leur langage d'écureuil.

Hare, professeur de zoologie à l'Université de Maniloha à Winnipeg, et son équipe ont réussi à enregistrer les appels d'alarme des écureuils. Les chercheurs ont étudié les sons et les ont ensuite rejoués à 60 écureuils sauvages, auxquels les scientifiques se sont approchés individuellement avec un enregistreur vidéo pour capturer leurs réponses. Certains écureuils ont levé la tête et sont devenus alertes. Les créatures qui étaient plus effrayées ont tout simplement pris la fuite et se sont réfugiées dans des grottes.

""En effet, les sifflements qui se mélangent aux ""chucks"" signifient ""il y a un ennemi de menace moyenne ici"", et les sifflements sans ""chucks"" signifient ""il y a un ennemi de menace apparemment moyenne quelque part dans les environs"", tandis que les gazouillis purs signifient ""je me cache ici car il y a un danger immédiat"". "" Hare a déclaré à Discovery News.

Hare et d'autres chercheurs pensent que ces sons font partie d'un langage avancé qui se développe comme tous les autres systèmes de communication.

Bien que les écureuils risquent leur vie lorsqu'ils appellent pour avertir les autres des menaces, les autres écureuils peuvent admirer ce comportement, augmentant ainsi le statut social de l'appelant, comme les humains qui admirent les héros. Hare a ajouté que d'autres animaux, comme les oiseaux, comprennent probablement au moins une partie du langage des écureuils, car ils peuvent également bénéficier des appels d'alarme.

En fait, une autre étude canadienne a révélé que les mésanges à tête noire, qui ont une voix grave, ont aussi leur propre langage. Selon certaines recherches, les appels des mésanges à tête noire contiennent de nombreux messages, tels que la direction des activités des compagnons, le maintien du contact entre les partenaires et l'alerte.

Alors que les mésanges à tête noire et d'autres oiseaux sont souvent les bienvenus dans les jardins par les propriétaires, les écureuils sont souvent considérés comme des nuisibles. Hare espère qu'une meilleure compréhension de la vie sociale complexe et des systèmes de communication des écureuils permettra de ""donner l'espoir que les humains développeront une plus grande appréciation et cesseront de faire du mal à ces animaux"".

"Le public a hoché la tête en signe d'accord lorsque l'orateur, un enseignant d'un collège communautaire, a déclaré : ""Les professeurs d'anglais du secondaire ne font pas leur travail."" Il a décrit les lacunes de ses élèves, tous diplômés du secondaire, qui ne peuvent utiliser le langage qu'au niveau de la 9e année. Je n'ai pas pu déterminer à partir de ses réponses à mes questions comment ce niveau de 9e année avait été élevé. 

Mon sujet n'est ni les normes ni leur déclin. Ce que l'orateur disait en réalité, c'est qu'il n'est plus jeune ; il enseigne depuis seize ans et est capable de penser et de parler comme un adulte. 

Mon point de vue est que les plaintes fréquentes d'une génération sur la suivante sont inévitables. C'est aussi dans la nature humaine de chercher la raison de notre insatisfaction. Avant que l'anglais ne devienne une matière scolaire à la fin du XIXe siècle, il était difficile de trouver la cible du blâme pour les limitations du langage. Mais depuis, les professeurs d'anglais sont constamment attaqués. 

Les plaignants pensent avoir trouvé une idée originale. À mesure que leur propre maîtrise du langage s'améliore, ils remarquent que les jeunes n'ont pas la même capacité. Ignorant que leur propre capacité s'est développée au fil des ans, ils prennent pour vrai que la nouvelle génération de jeunes doit être désespérée à cet égard. Aux yeux et aux oreilles des adultes, le langage des jeunes ne semble jamais suffisant. 

Puisque cette préoccupation concernant la chute de la langue anglaise n'est pas considérée comme un phénomène générationnel, mais plutôt comme quelque chose de nouveau pour les jeunes d'aujourd'hui, il s'ensuit naturellement que les professeurs d'anglais d'aujourd'hui ne peuvent pas faire leur travail. Autrement, les jeunes ne feraient pas d'erreurs de langage.

"De nos jours, de nombreux étudiants aiment jouer à des jeux 3D. Savez-vous à quoi ressemblent les jeux 3D ? Dans la plupart des jeux 3D, les joueurs doivent contrôler un personnage. Le personnage peut être un robot ou un soldat. Les joueurs utilisent généralement la souris pour faire bouger le personnage dans son propre monde. Les joueurs peuvent trouver des choses comme de la nourriture et des armes pour les aider à continuer le jeu. Le personnage peut aller tout droit, s'asseoir, tourner à gauche, tourner à droite ou ramasser des objets dans le jeu. 

Certains jeux 3D ont plusieurs niveaux. Le personnage doit atteindre différents objectifs pour chaque niveau. Les joueurs peuvent affronter leurs ordinateurs, et parfois ils peuvent jouer avec d'autres joueurs en ligne. C'est très amusant de jouer à des jeux 3D.

"En rentrant du travail un soir sous une pluie battante, j'ai trouvé un chat très mouillé et blessé au bord de la route. Il m'a regardé en miaulant piteusement. Une voiture devait l'avoir heurté car il était incapable de bouger. J'ai arrêté ma voiture, j'ai pris le chat dans mes bras et j'ai continué à rouler.

À la clinique vétérinaire la plus proche, le vétérinaire l'a examiné doucement. ""Il a environ huit mois et a deux pattes cassées, mais j'aurais besoin de radiographies pour savoir quelle est la gravité des dommages"", m'a-t-il dit. ""Comme ce n'est pas votre chat, je ne sais pas si vous voulez poursuivre. Cela pourrait être assez coûteux.""

Je savais que cela me coûterait des centaines de dollars, mais j'ai accepté son conseil. Le lendemain matin, le vétérinaire a appelé pour dire que les rayons X confirmaient deux fractures graves à ses pattes. ""Je vais opérer ses pattes et mettre des broches métalliques pour les maintenir fixées"", m'a-t-il dit.

Cet après-midi, je suis allé chercher mon petit ami. Là, je l'ai à peine reconnu. Sa fourrure autrefois sale était maintenant d'un beau gris argenté. Ses pattes avant étaient dans deux plâtres et il était allongé là, me regardant en ronronnant joyeusement.

J'ai remercié le docteur et je suis sorti pour payer la facture. ""Je pense que vous m'avez donné le mauvais compte"", ai-je dit à la caissière. ""Ce n'est que 85 $. Il a fait des rayons X et une opération à ses pattes."" ""Non, c'est correct"", a-t-elle répondu. ""Le vétérinaire ne vous a facturé que les médicaments. Il y a un message au bas de la facture.""

Écrit sous le total figurait les mots ""TARIF SPÉCIAL POUR ADOPTIONS."" J'étais sans voix devant son geste gentil et généreux. J'ai payé la facture et sous son message j'ai écrit ""AVEC DES REMERCIEMENTS RECONNAISSANTS, CHAT ET MAMAN.""

"Ralentir le vieillissement. C'est le message que le Dr Shen Ziyin veut faire passer au monde. Et le médecin chinois affirme avoir trouvé une solution aux problèmes du vieillissement. Sa solution est une médecine à base de plantes pour ralentir le processus de vieillissement.

Le Dr Shen Ziyin a été formé à la médecine occidentale. En même temps, il a étudié la médecine traditionnelle chinoise. Et il travaille depuis quarante ans pour réunir le meilleur des deux et trouver un remède contre le vieillissement. Il s'est inspiré de l'ancien système de médecine chinoise appelé ""Shen"".

Selon Shen, c'est le rein qui ajuste le fonctionnement du corps ainsi que son processus de vieillissement. Il est responsable du niveau d'activité que les corps humains subissent. Des études menées par le Dr Shen montrent que la médecine à base de plantes basée sur le système Shen ralentit le processus de vieillissement, selon un rapport du journal The Telegraph. On remarque que lorsque les gens vieillissent, ils ont une force réduite, une perte de cheveux, des maux de dos, une faiblesse, des rides et ainsi de suite. Cela se produit parce que lorsque les gens vieillissent, leur corps produit des lymphocytes T. Ces lymphocytes T contiennent une substance particulière appelée Fas. Fas fait que les cellules du corps se détruisent elles-mêmes.

Donc, la seule façon de ralentir le vieillissement est de ralentir la production de lymphocytes T dans le corps. Cela peut arriver si les gens mangent des aliments hypocaloriques. Ensuite, le corps n'est pas assez actif pour produire des lymphocytes T supplémentaires. Mais, est-ce que mourir de faim tout le temps est un bon prix à payer pour rester jeune ? C'est là qu'intervient la médecine à base de plantes du Dr Shen. Mais son efficacité ne pourra être confirmée que par le temps.

"Apollo 11, transportant Neil Armstrong, Edwin Aldrin et Michael Collins, a été lancé le 16 juillet 1969. Cinq jours plus tard, ils ont marché sur la lune.

Neil Armstrong

Sur le chemin : De toutes les vues magnifiques que nous avons eues, la plus impressionnante pour moi a été sur le chemin de la Lune lorsque nous avons volé à travers son ombre. Nous étions encore à des milliers de kilomètres, mais assez près pour que la Lune remplisse presque notre fenêtre. La lune est apparue bleu-gris. Elle semblait presque nous montrer sa rondeur, sa similarité de forme avec notre Terre, dans une sorte d'accueil. J'étais sûr qu'elle serait un hôte accueillant. Elle attendait ses premiers visiteurs depuis longtemps.

Après l'atterrissage : Le ciel est noir, vous savez. C'est un ciel très sombre, mais il semblait toujours plus clair que sombre quand on regardait par la fenêtre. C'est une chose très étrange, mais la surface semblait très chaude et invitante. Elle semblait être beige. C'est difficile à expliquer, parce que plus tard, quand j'ai tenu le matériau dans ma main, il n'était pas beige du tout. Il était noir, gris, etc.

"## Services aux étudiants 
## Union des étudiants

Chaque université possède une Union des étudiants. Si les étudiants sont le sang vital d'une université, l'Union est certainement son cœur battant. 

## Pour les étudiants, par les étudiants
Une Union des étudiants est gérée par des étudiants et agit de manière indépendante. À la fin de chaque année académique, elle choisit six étudiants pour occuper un poste de sabbatical, gérant l'Union pour l'année à venir. Le fait que les six officiers de sabbatical élus aient récemment vécu les difficultés rencontrées par les étudiants garantit que vos besoins sont parfaitement compris.

## Se détendre
Bien que l'université soit répartie sur une zone assez étendue, l'Union est située au centre et se trouve à quelques pas de tous les bâtiments principaux. Cela permet de retrouver facilement des amis qui suivent peut-être un cursus différent. 

Le soir, l'endroit s'anime vraiment - nous disposons de trois bars différents pour tous les goûts. Les lieux sont réservés aux étudiants, vous êtes donc sûr de rencontrer des personnes ayant une vision similaire et nous offrons un service de transport pour vous assurer un retour à la maison en toute sécurité. 

L'Union organise également divers bals formels tout au long de l'année, le point culminant étant le bal de fin d'année.

## Vous soutenir
Au-delà du divertissement, nous veillons également à ce que certains des problèmes plus sérieux soient traités efficacement. Si vous avez un problème avec votre cursus, un autre officier de sabbatical est formé pour vous aider. Notre indépendance de l'université nous permet de vous représenter et de vous soutenir au mieux de nos capacités. Une fois arrivé à l'université, vous découvrirez peut-être que vous êtes sensibilisé à des problèmes nationaux ou politiques plus importants.

"Par une chaude journée d'été, une boisson gazeuse peut vraiment étancher votre soif. À la maison, à l'école, au parc ou au cinéma - vous pouvez en trouver presque partout.

**Boissons gazeuses**
Vous pouvez voir des bulles dans celles-ci ! Environ 75 % des boissons gazeuses vendues sont gazeuses. Mais attention, les boissons gazeuses contiennent beaucoup de sucre et de caféine. La caféine n'est pas très bonne pour vous en été car elle élimine l'eau de votre corps. Et le sucre peut vous faire grossir si vous en buvez trop.

**Jus de fruits**
Il existe différents types de jus. Un type est fait uniquement à partir de fruits frais. Ce type de jus de fruits peut ne pas avoir un goût assez sucré pour certaines personnes, mais il est nutritif. Un autre type de jus de fruits a bon goût mais contient beaucoup de sucre. De nombreux jeunes achètent ce type parce que les publicités sont bonnes. Il est mauvais pour vos dents et vos os de boire beaucoup de ceci.

**Boissons énergisantes**
Ces types de boissons contiennent de la caféine et des éléments qui rendent les gens excités. On les appelle parfois des ""boissons de fête"". Les médecins disent que si vous en buvez trop, vous risquez de faire une crise cardiaque.

**Eau en bouteille**
Nous avons de nombreux types d'eau en bouteille différents, comme l'eau minérale, l'eau purifiée et l'eau distillée. Elles sont propres et faciles à boire. Mais il est préférable de ne pas boire d'eau très froide. Cela pourrait vous donner mal à l'estomac.

**Boissons pour sportifs**
La plupart d'entre elles ont des noms amusants comme ""Scream"" et ""G-Vital"". Elles contiennent beaucoup de vitamines et de minéraux. Après avoir fait du sport, vous voudrez peut-être en boire une.

"Obtenir un diplôme d'une université de renommée mondiale ne suffit peut-être pas pour faire fortune à l'avenir. Une nouvelle étude de l'Université d'Essex en Grande-Bretagne a montré que plus vous avez d'amis à l'école, plus vous gagnerez d'argent par la suite.
L'idée que la popularité puisse avoir une influence sérieuse sur le potentiel de gain ne devrait pas être une surprise. Les chercheurs ont noté que si vous voulez réussir dans la vie, les compétences sociales et le réseautage sont tout aussi puissants que le talent et le travail acharné.
""Si une personne a beaucoup d'amis, cela signifie qu'elle a la capacité de s'entendre avec les autres dans toutes sortes de situations différentes"", a déclaré Xu Yanchun, 17 ans, de Nantou High School à Shenzhen, qui était totalement d'accord avec la récente découverte. ""De plus, les amis s'entraident toujours. Ils ne créent pas seulement des cercles sociaux plus larges pour vous, mais ils vous remontent le moral lorsque vous êtes occasionnellement déprimé"", a déclaré Xu. Elle croyait que tout cela vous aide à ""gagner un salaire plus élevé"".
C'est peut-être pourquoi certaines personnes pensent que les jeunes générations sont à l'ère du Friendalholisme. Une femme s'est même plainte que la limite de 5 000 amis du site de réseautage Facebook était trop basse pour sa grande réserve de contacts sociaux.
Mais qu'est-ce qu'un ami signifie ? Les amis doivent-ils être considérés comme une forme de monnaie ?
""Appelez-moi pas cool, mais je pense à un ami comme une personne réelle avec laquelle j'ai une histoire réelle et que j'aime vraiment voir. Il semble cependant que ce ne soit plus la définition d'un ami"", a déclaré Meghan Daum, qui travaille avec The Los Angeles Times aux États-Unis.
Daum n'aime pas l'idée que la quantité _ la qualité à l'ère du Friendaholisme. Elle pensait que l'idée d'amitié, du moins parmi la population croissante des utilisateurs de réseaux sociaux sur Internet, était d'avoir autant de non-amis que possible. Par exemple, un ami pourrait être une personne que vous connaissez personnellement, mais qui pourrait tout aussi bien être l'ami d'un ami d'un autre ami Facebook que vous ne connaissez pas réellement. Bien qu'elle ait convenu que les liens sociaux facilitent le roulement de la vie, elle a également averti. ""Dommage qu'une chose que l'argent ne peut pas acheter est un véritable ami.""

"Le sport n'est pas seulement un défi physique, mais aussi mental. Les critiques des entraîneurs, des parents et des autres coéquipiers, ainsi que la pression de gagner, peuvent créer trop d'anxiété ou de stress pour les jeunes athlètes. Le stress peut être physique, émotionnel ou psychologique, et la recherche a montré qu'il peut conduire à l'épuisement professionnel. L'épuisement professionnel a été décrit comme l'abandon ou l'arrêt d'une activité qui était autrefois agréable.

Les premières années de développement sont des années cruciales pour l'apprentissage de soi. Le milieu sportif est un endroit où des expériences précieuses peuvent avoir lieu. Les jeunes athlètes peuvent, par exemple, apprendre à coopérer avec les autres, se faire des amis et acquérir d'autres compétences sociales qui leur serviront tout au long de leur vie. Les entraîneurs et les parents doivent toujours être conscients que leurs commentaires aux jeunes peuvent avoir un impact considérable sur leurs enfants. Les jeunes peuvent prendre à cœur les critiques de leurs parents et de leurs entraîneurs et trouver un défaut en eux-mêmes.

Les entraîneurs et les parents doivent également faire attention à ce que la participation au sport des jeunes ne devienne pas un travail pour les enfants. Le résultat du match ne doit pas être plus important que le processus d'apprentissage du sport et d'autres leçons de vie. Dans le contexte actuel du sport des jeunes, les jeunes athlètes peuvent être plus préoccupés par qui va gagner que par le plaisir qu'ils prennent à pratiquer le sport. Après un match, de nombreux parents et entraîneurs se concentrent sur le résultat et trouvent des failles dans les performances des jeunes. Un renforcement positif doit être fourni malgré le résultat. La recherche montre que le renforcement positif motive et a un effet plus important sur l'apprentissage que la critique. Encore une fois, la critique peut créer des niveaux élevés de stress, ce qui peut conduire à l'épuisement professionnel.

"Les rêves peuvent être familiers et étranges, fantastiques ou ennuyeux, mais certains rêves peuvent être liés aux processus mentaux qui nous aident à apprendre. Dans une étude récente, des scientifiques ont trouvé un lien entre les rêves de sieste et une meilleure mémoire chez les personnes qui apprenaient une nouvelle compétence.

Dans l'étude, 99 étudiants universitaires âgés de 18 à 30 ans ont passé une heure devant un ordinateur, essayant de traverser un labyrinthe virtuel. Le labyrinthe était différent à chaque fois qu'ils essayaient, ce qui rendait la tâche encore plus difficile. On leur a également dit de trouver une image particulière d'un arbre et de se souvenir de son emplacement.

Pendant les 90 premières minutes d'une pause de cinq heures, la moitié des participants sont restés éveillés et l'autre moitié ont été invités à faire une courte sieste. Les participants qui sont restés éveillés ont été invités à décrire leurs pensées. Les participants qui ont fait une sieste ont été interrogés sur leurs rêves avant le sommeil et après le sommeil, et ils ont été réveillés dans la minute qui suivait l'endormissement pour décrire leurs rêves.

Stickgold, un neuroscientifique, voulait savoir ce que les gens rêvaient lorsque leurs yeux ne bougeaient pas pendant le sommeil.

Quatre des 50 personnes qui ont dormi ont déclaré que leurs rêves étaient liés au labyrinthe. Certaines ont rêvé de la musique qui jouait lorsqu'elles travaillaient ; d'autres ont dit qu'elles rêvaient de voir des gens dans le labyrinthe. Lorsque ces quatre personnes ont retenté le labyrinthe informatique, elles ont pu trouver l'arbre plus rapidement qu'avant leur sieste.

Stickgold suggère que le rêve lui-même n'aide pas une personne à apprendre, mais que c'est le contraire. Il soupçonne que le rêve a été causé par les processus cérébraux associés à l'apprentissage.

Les quatre personnes qui ont rêvé de la tâche avaient mal performé la première fois, ce qui fait se demander à Stickgold si les rêves apparaissent lorsqu'une personne trouve une nouvelle tâche particulièrement difficile. Les personnes qui ont fait d'autres rêves, ou les personnes qui n'ont pas fait de sieste, n'ont pas montré la même amélioration.

"Brad ferma la porte doucement alors que Sue partait pour aller rendre visite à sa mère. S'attendant à une journée entière de détente, il se demandait s'il devait lire le journal ou regarder son émission de télévision préférée le premier jour de congé après des mois. ""Ce sera une promenade de santé"", avait-il dit à sa femme. ""Je vais m'occuper des enfants et tu peux aller voir ta mère.""

Les choses ont bien commencé, mais juste après huit heures, ses trois petits ""bons enfants"" - Mike, Randy et Alex - sont descendus les escaliers en pyjama et ont crié ""petit déjeuner, papa"". Lorsque la nourriture n'était pas apparue dans les trente secondes, Randy a commencé à utiliser sa cuillère sur la tête d'Alex comme si c'était un tambour. Alex a commencé à crier fort au rythme du battement. Mike chantait ""Où est mon toast, où est mon toast"" en arrière-plan. Brad a réalisé que son journal devrait attendre quelques secondes.

La vie s'est aggravée après le petit-déjeuner. Mike portait les sous-vêtements de Randy sur la tête. Randy s'est enfermé dans la salle de bain, tandis qu'Alex criait à nouveau parce qu'il allait faire pipi dans son pantalon. Personne ne pouvait trouver de chaussettes propres, bien qu'elles soient devant leurs yeux. Quelqu'un du nom de ""Pas Moi"" avait renversé un verre entier de jus d'orange dans le panier de vêtements propres. Brad savait que l'émission de télévision avait déjà commencé.

Vers dix heures, les choses étaient hors de contrôle. Alex se demandait pourquoi le poisson dans le bocal refusait son pain et son beurre. Mike tentait de montrer son talent en décorant le mur de la cuisine avec ses crayons de couleur. Randy, heureusement, semblait lire tranquillement dans la salle familiale, mais un examen plus approfondi a montré qu'il mangeait de la confiture de pommes directement du pot avec ses mains. Brad a réalisé que l'émission de télévision était terminée et que la lecture serait impossible.

À exactement 11h17, Brad a appelé la garderie. ""Je dois soudainement aller au travail et ma femme est absente. Puis-je amener les garçons dans quelques minutes ?"" La réponse était évidemment ""oui"" parce que Brad souriait.

"Soyons honnêtes : si vous aimez prendre beaucoup de vacances, les États-Unis ne sont pas l'endroit où travailler. Outre une poignée de jours fériés nationaux, le travailleur américain typique ne dispose que de deux ou trois précieuses semaines de congé par an pour se détendre et découvrir le monde, soit beaucoup moins que ce que reçoivent les employés de nombreux autres pays. Seuls 57 % des travailleurs américains utilisent tous les jours auxquels ils ont droit, contre 89 % des travailleurs français, selon une récente étude.

Alors, que se passe-t-il ici ? Une grande partie de la différence tient au fait que le congé payé est soutenu par la loi dans de nombreuses parties du monde. L'Allemagne figure parmi plus de deux douzaines de pays industrialisés, de l'Australie à la Slovénie en passant par le Japon, qui exigent des employeurs qu'ils offrent à leurs travailleurs quatre semaines ou plus de vacances payées, selon une étude de 2009 du cabinet de conseil en ressources humaines Mercer. La Finlande, le Brésil et la France sont les champions, garantissant six semaines de congé.

Mais les employeurs américains n'ont aucune obligation en vertu de la loi fédérale d'offrir des vacances payées, de sorte qu'environ un quart de tous les travailleurs américains n'y ont pas accès, selon les chiffres du gouvernement. Cela fait des États-Unis la seule nation développée au monde qui ne garantit pas à ses travailleurs un congé annuel, selon un rapport intitulé ""NoVacation Nation"" du Center for Economic and Policy Research, un groupe politique libéral.

Mais la peur des licenciements et le rythme de travail toujours plus rapide signifient que de nombreux Américains ne veulent pas être absents du bureau, craignant de donner l'impression de ne pas vouloir travailler dur. Ou ils craignent de ne pas pouvoir gérer l'arriéré de travail qui les attend après des vacances.

Travailler plus rend les Américains plus heureux que les Européens, selon une étude publiée récemment dans le Journal of Happiness Studies. Cela peut s'expliquer par le fait que les Américains croient plus que les Européens que le travail acharné est associé au succès, écrit Adam OkuliczKozaryn, auteur de l'étude et professeur adjoint à l'Université du Texas à Dallas. ""Les Américains augmentent leur bonheur en travaillant, et les Européens augmentent leur bonheur en prenant des vacances"", a-t-il constaté.

"Les vitamines sont des substances chimiques complexes que l'on trouve dans de nombreux aliments. Le corps humain en a besoin pour sa santé et sa croissance. Le corps fabrique certaines vitamines, mais généralement en quantités trop faibles pour répondre à ses besoins. D'autres vitamines ne sont pas produites par le corps. Celles-ci doivent être fournies. Personne ne sait exactement comment toutes les vitamines fonctionnent. Les médecins savent que les vitamines ont des usages très spécifiques. Une vitamine ne peut donc pas remplacer une autre. L'absence constante d'une vitamine dans un régime alimentaire par ailleurs complet provoque une maladie de carence. Le rachitisme, le scorbut et la pellagre en sont des exemples.

Il est préférable d'obtenir des vitamines en consommant les aliments dans lesquels elles se trouvent. Il existe également des pilules contenant une seule vitamine ou une combinaison de vitamines. Les gens devraient consulter leur médecin avant de prendre des pilules de vitamines.

Les scientifiques ont découvert environ 25 vitamines et leurs différentes formes qui sont très importantes pour les êtres humains et les autres formes de vie. Les experts pensent qu'il existe de nombreuses autres vitamines à découvrir.

Il existe deux groupes de base de vitamines. Un groupe de vitamines se dissout dans les graisses et est donc appelé groupe ""liposoluble"". Les vitamines A, D, E et K font partie de ce groupe. L'autre groupe est connu sous le nom de vitamines ""hydrosolubles"". Ces vitamines, comme on peut s'y attendre, se dissolvent dans l'eau. Parmi ce groupe figurent la vitamine C et le groupe des vitamines B.

La vitamine A aide à la construction et à la croissance des cellules du corps. Cette vitamine est donc essentielle à la croissance des enfants et au bon développement des bébés avant la naissance. La vitamine A est également importante pour une bonne vision de nuit. La vitamine B1 est également appelée thiamine. Cette vitamine prévient et guérit les maladies. La vitamine B2, appelée riboflavine, est nécessaire à la croissance, à la santé de la peau et à la vision. La vitamine C, ou acide ascorbique, prévient et guérit le scorbut.

La vitamine D est un groupe de 10 vitamines qui prévient le rachitisme. Les scientifiques pensent que la vitamine D3 se forme dans la peau lorsque le corps est exposé à la lumière du soleil. C'est pourquoi elle est appelée la ""vitamine du soleil"". Un manque de vitamine D peut entraîner des dommages osseux ; un excès peut provoquer une maladie rénale.

Toutes les fonctions de la vitamine E, également appelée tocophérol, ne sont pas connues. Elle est nécessaire à la reproduction chez les animaux. La vitamine K est nécessaire à la coagulation du sang.

Plus on apprend sur les vitamines, plus on réalise à quel point ces substances chimiques jouent un rôle dans tous les aspects de l'activité humaine.

"Enfant, j'ai lu un livre avec une image montrant un homme lisant flottant sur la mer Morte. Quel miracle ! Quelle sensation de s'allonger dans une eau si épaisse en sel qu'il est impossible de couler ? 

Alimentée par le Jourdain et de petits ruisseaux, la mer Morte est le point le plus bas de la surface de la Terre, et son eau est dix fois plus salée que la Méditerranée. L'évaporation étant sa seule échappatoire, le sel et les autres minéraux deviennent super concentrés.

Plus tôt cette année, j'ai parcouru la longue et raide colline pour réaliser mon rêve. La côte était une large étendue de boue salée, mais le bord de l'eau était hors de vue. On aurait dit que quelqu'un avait tiré la bonde de la mer Morte. Eli Dior, un responsable israélien, a expliqué le problème : ""La mer Morte s'assèche. Chaque année, la surface baisse d'environ un mètre, et au fur et à mesure que le niveau de l'eau baisse, des zones peu profondes se retrouvent à sec.""

Au cours du dernier demi-siècle, les cinq pays voisins ont utilisé presque toute l'eau qui coule dans la mer Morte pour répondre aux besoins humains et agricoles. Résultat : la mer Morte se vide.

Avec une population dans les pays voisins devant au moins doubler au cours des 50 prochaines années, il y a peu d'espoir de restaurer l'eau utilisée dans cette zone. Aucun pays n'a une goutte à épargner pour la mer Morte, où ils savent qu'elle va tout simplement s'évaporer. Rêver d'ouvrir les barrages et de restaurer l'équilibre naturel est irréaliste.

Pourtant, un rêve ambitieux de haute technologie pourrait bien être non seulement la solution à la mer Morte, mais aussi un ticket pour la paix autour de ses rives. Le ""Red-Dead"" est un projet de 5 milliards de dollars proposé pour amener de l'eau de mer sur environ 240 kilomètres par pipeline et canal de la mer Rouge à la mer Morte. Le Red-Dead pourrait être la seule solution, mais même si le projet est mené à bien, la mer Morte sera 10 à 20 mètres plus basse qu'aujourd'hui et les deux tiers de sa taille actuelle.

Quoi qu'il arrive, le mélange magique de soleil, de boue, de mer et de sel de la mer Morte survivra certainement. Beaucoup pourraient se plaindre que la mer Morte est à moitié vide - mais pour moi, la mer Morte sera toujours à moitié pleine.

"La Saint-Valentin, pour de nombreux couples, rime avec cartes, fleurs et dîners aux chandelles. Pour la plupart des couples, cela signifie également retirer de l'argent au guichet automatique pour exprimer leur amour. Heureusement, il existe des moyens d'économiser de l'argent en économisant de l'énergie, même pendant le rendez-vous, afin de pouvoir dépenser l'argent économisé pour les choses qui comptent vraiment pour votre bien-aimé. Voici cinq conseils simples pour les couples qui souhaitent économiser de l'énergie et de l'argent :

Une cheminée est toujours un arrière-plan parfait pour installer des décorations de vacances en raison de l'espace qu'elle offre, en plus du rôle majeur qu'elle joue dans la maison en étant une partie importante de chaque pièce. Si vous prévoyez de passer votre Saint-Valentin près de la cheminée, assurez-vous d'empêcher les pertes de chaleur et de vérifier l'efficacité de la cheminée. Si vous n'utilisez jamais votre cheminée, bouchez et scellez le conduit de la cheminée.

Si vous prévoyez de prendre un bon dîner romantique à la maison et que vous souhaitez créer l'ambiance avec un éclairage adéquat, utilisez des ampoules à économie d'énergie qui vous font économiser de l'argent et recherchez des ampoules avec un faible nombre de lumens. Les lumens indiquent la luminosité de l'ampoule. Plus le nombre de lumens est faible, plus la lumière est faible.

Pour ceux qui prévoient de préparer ce dîner romantique, il existe des moyens simples d'économiser de l'énergie pour préparer le repas. Par exemple, saviez-vous que si vous faites cuire au four dans un plat en porcelaine ou en verre, vous pouvez généralement régler votre four 25 degrés de moins que ce que la recette indique ? En savoir plus sur l'économie d'énergie en cuisine.

Pour les couples qui souhaitent organiser une soirée cinéma, branchez votre téléviseur et votre lecteur DVD sur une multiprise électronique pour économiser de l'argent sur l'essence de votre voiture. En branchant les appareils électroniques sur une multiprise et en l'éteignant lorsqu'elle n'est pas utilisée, vous pouvez économiser jusqu'à 100 $ par an.

Si vous prévoyez de faire une « évasion » romantique de votre maison en voiture, assurez-vous de consulter ces conseils pour réduire la consommation de carburant et les coûts.

"Liu Hui est très excité. Les élèves d'une école de Shanghai vont se rendre aux États-Unis avec ses parents pendant le Nouvel An chinois. ""Voyager à l'étranger a toujours été un rêve pour moi"", dit-il joyeusement.

Aujourd'hui, les Chinois profitent de vacances plus longues, comme les trois ""Golden Week Holidays"" (le Nouvel An chinois, le 1er mai et la fête nationale). Ils ont plus de temps pour voyager. La hausse des revenus rend également les voyages à l'étranger réalistes pour les Chinois ordinaires.

Près de 7 millions de Chinois ont voyagé à l'étranger en 2001, selon l'Administration nationale du tourisme. Le problème le plus courant auquel sont confrontés les voyageurs est de choisir les meilleurs itinéraires.

Fin 2002, les citoyens chinois étaient autorisés à se rendre dans 19 pays et régions étrangers à leurs frais.

Les 10 premières destinations comprenaient Hong Kong, Macao et la Thaïlande. Les pays européens sont également de plus en plus populaires.

""De plus en plus de Chinois ont montré un intérêt pour les voyages en Europe, en particulier en France et en Finlande"", a déclaré Tan Wen, directeur général de China Youth Travel Service. ""Tôt ou tard, il y aura un pic de voyages européens.""

Une autre considération est de choisir les bonnes agences de voyages et de trouver le meilleur prix. La China Consumers' Association (CCA) a offert des conseils aux consommateurs sur le choix des bonnes agences de voyages pour éviter qu'une vacance relaxante ne se transforme en un désastre coûteux.

""Le prix ne doit pas être le facteur le plus important dans le choix d'une agence de voyages"", a déclaré Zhang Yuanchao, vice-secrétaire général de la CCA. Les consommateurs sont invités à choisir de grandes agences de voyages d'État ayant une bonne réputation et une approbation officielle pour organiser des groupes de voyages à l'étranger.

L'association de Zhang a traité plus de 5 000 plaintes concernant les agences de voyages l'année dernière. Et la majorité des plaintes concernaient des _ dans les itinéraires de voyage, de mauvais guides touristiques et des achats forcés.

"""Le Seigneur des Anneaux"", l'un des best-sellers du nouveau millénaire, était composé de trois parties : ""La Communauté de l'Anneau"", ""Les Deux Tours"" et ""Le Retour du Roi"". Des millions et des millions de personnes l'ont lu dans plus de 25 langues différentes, mais peu connaissent l'auteur et l'histoire de la composition de cette œuvre maîtresse de la création.
John Ronald Refuel Tolkien est né en Afrique du Sud en 1892. Ses parents sont morts alors qu'il était enfant. Vivant en Angleterre avec sa tante, Tolkien et ses cousins ont inventé des langues de jeu, un passe-temps qui a conduit Tolkien à devenir compétent en gallois, grec, gothique, vieux norrois et anglo-saxon.
Après avoir obtenu son diplôme d'Oxford, Tolkien a servi pendant la Première Guerre mondiale. En 1917, alors qu'il se remettait de la fièvre des tranchées, il a commencé à composer la mythologie du Seigneur des Anneaux. En tant que professeur d'anglo-saxon dans les années 1930 à Oxford, Tolkien faisait partie d'un groupe de discussion informel appelé les Inklings, qui comprenait plusieurs écrivains. Le groupe écoutait bientôt des chapitres de l'œuvre imaginative de Tolkien, ""Le Hobbit"".
Hobbit était un nom que Tolkien a créé pour des personnes qui pouvaient être décrites au mieux comme des membres de la classe rurale anglaise à moitié grandeur nature. Les hobbits vivent dans des trous à flanc de colline. L'un d'eux, Bilbon Sacquet, part à la recherche de trésors avec un groupe de nains. En chemin, il rencontre la créature tordue et pitoyable Gollum, dont il voit un anneau d'or qui rend son porteur invisible.
L'une des étudiantes de Tolkien a persuadé son employeur, l'éditeur Allen & Unwind, de regarder un brouillon. Le président de la firme, Stanley Unwind, a estimé que le meilleur juge pour un livre pour enfants serait son fils de dix ans. Le garçon a gagné un shilling pour avoir rapporté que l'aventure était passionnante, et ""Le Hobbit"" a été publié en 1937.
Il s'est si bien vendu qu'Unwind a demandé une suite. Plus d'une douzaine d'années plus tard, en 1954, Tolkien a produit ""Le Seigneur des Anneaux"", une série de livres si créatifs qu'ils captivent les lecteurs, nouveaux et anciens, depuis leur publication.

"What do you think of black cats? Are they unluckier than cats of other colors? Many people in Western countries think so. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities.
The study found that people do judge  cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey  on the Internet. There were 49 statements   matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured   cats are friendly, tri-coloured   cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities.
But why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation  . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween. Movies and television shows also make people believe that.
Although people have these ideas, UC Berkeley scientists give another reason: people don't think black cats are pretty enough. After all, nothing can show black cats are unluckier than other cats.

"Depuis des milliers d'années, les gens débattent du sens du bonheur et de la façon de le trouver. Des Grecs et des Romains antiques aux écrivains et professeurs d'aujourd'hui, le débat sur le bonheur se poursuit. Qu'est-ce qui rend quelqu'un heureux ? Dans quelles parties du monde les gens sont-ils les plus heureux ? Pourquoi étudier le bonheur ? Le philosophe grec Aristote affirmait que le bonheur suprême d'une personne provenait de l'utilisation de son intelligence. Des livres religieux comme le Coran et la Bible évoquent la foi comme une forme de bonheur. Le scientifique britannique Charles Darwin croyait que toutes les espèces étaient formées de manière à profiter du bonheur. Les gens tout au long de l'histoire ont peut-être eu des idées différentes sur le bonheur. Mais aujourd'hui, beaucoup de gens sont toujours à la recherche de son sens.

Comment étudie-t-on quelque chose comme le bonheur ? Vous pourriez commencer par la World Database of Happiness à l'université Erasmus de Rotterdam, aux Pays-Bas. Cet ensemble d'informations inclut la façon de définir et de mesurer le bonheur. Certaines conclusions ne sont pas surprenantes. Par exemple, la base de données suggère que les personnes mariées sont plus heureuses que les personnes célibataires. Les personnes qui aiment être avec d'autres personnes sont plus heureuses que les personnes asociables. Mais d'autres conclusions sont moins attendues : les personnes ayant des enfants sont aussi heureuses que les couples sans enfants. Et les personnes plus riches ne sont que légèrement plus heureuses que les personnes plus pauvres.

La psychologie positive est le nouveau terme pour une méthode d'étude scientifique qui tente d'examiner les choses qui donnent un sens à la vie au lieu des problèmes de la vie. La psychologie traditionnelle étudie généralement les situations négatives comme la souffrance mentale et la maladie. Mais la psychologie positive vise à étudier les forces qui permettent aux personnes et aux communautés de bien faire. Il existe également un nombre croissant de recherches médicales sur les qualités physiques du bonheur. Les médecins peuvent maintenant observer le bonheur à l'œuvre dans le cerveau d'une personne en utilisant une méthode appelée imagerie par résonance magnétique, ou IRM. Par exemple, une IRM peut montrer comment une zone du cerveau d'une personne s'active lorsqu'elle regarde des images joyeuses. Une autre zone du cerveau s'active lorsque la personne voit des images de sujets terribles.

"Un service de géolocalisation (GPS) aide les personnes âgées du district de Panlong à Kunming, capitale de la province du Yunnan dans le sud-ouest de la Chine.

Le fournisseur de services de télécommunications, avec le soutien du gouvernement local, a lancé le service de suivi GPS en janvier pour aider les personnes âgées, en particulier celles atteintes de la maladie d'Alzheimer, une maladie qui détruit lentement la mémoire.

Huang Haiying, une employée d'une compagnie de télécommunications locale, a déclaré à China Daily qu'avec les appareils GPS, les personnes qui s'occupent des personnes âgées peuvent rapidement trouver leur position en ligne ou en appelant le centre de service en cas d'urgence.

Le système est également connecté à la police, aux hôpitaux, aux services d'incendie et aux centres de services communautaires pour garantir que les personnes âgées reçoivent une aide rapide et appropriée, a déclaré Huang.

Les experts ont déclaré que ce service pourrait améliorer la qualité de vie de milliers de personnes âgées atteintes d'Alzheimer, de leurs familles et de ceux qui s'en occupent.

Des centaines de personnes ont déjà été aidées par le service cette année, a déclaré Huang.

Huang a déclaré que le système compte environ 10 000 abonnés et qu'elle s'attend à ce que ce nombre soit multiplié par 10 au cours des trois prochaines années. Un utilisateur paie 25 yuans (4 $) par mois pour le service. Une famille dont le revenu est inférieur au seuil de pauvreté local peut obtenir une subvention de 10 yuans chaque mois du gouvernement.

Le gouvernement local a dépensé plus de 2 millions de yuans pour subventionner le service à ce jour.

Rao Yuehui, directeur du département des affaires civiles de Panlong, a déclaré qu'environ 90 000 personnes, soit 15,4 % de la population du district, ont plus de 60 ans.

He Xiangqun, un fonctionnaire du département des affaires civiles de la province du Yunnan, a déclaré que cela signifie que la population répond aux normes internationales qui la classent comme une société vieillissante, comme le définit les Nations unies.

"Il y a quelques années, je dînais avec une personne qui n'arrêtait pas de parler de lui-même, complètement inconscient du fait que j'étais assis là, dans le malheur. Ce n'était pas sa compagnie qui me décevait. Je me remettais d'une mauvaise note à mes études. J'aurais pu m'effondrer en larmes à table.
Lorsque nous avons pris la note, la serveuse a dit : ""Votre repas a déjà été payé."" Mon ami et moi n'avions aucune idée de ce qui s'était passé. Puis je me suis souvenu d'un homme entrant dans le coin de mon œil. Il était vêtu principalement de blanc, s'est assis au bar, a bu un verre de vin, est resté environ dix minutes puis est parti. La serveuse a dit : ""Oui, le monsieur qui était ici il y a un moment vous a payé.""
L'année dernière, je courais un semi-marathon. À 0,1 mile de l'arrivée, j'étais à court d'essence. Les coureurs appellent ça ""frapper le mur"" ; je pensais ne plus pouvoir bouger un muscle. Soudain, un adolescent a trottiné à côté de moi et a dit : ""Comment tu t'appelles ma belle ? Jennifer ? Ok Jennifer, on y va ! Allez ! C'est juste au coin de la rue ! Tu peux le faire !"" Et il a couru avec moi jusqu'à ce que je reprenne mon rythme. Je l'ai retrouvé à la ligne d'arrivée pour le remercier de son encouragement, mais j'ai appris qu'il n'était même pas censé participer à la course ce jour-là. Il courait à la place de quelqu'un d'autre.

Ainsi, se sentant inférieure, la graine ne donnait aucune importance à son existence. Puis un jour, un vent l'a emportée et l'a jetée dans un champ ouvert au soleil.

"Suivre certains conseils pour une vie écologique contribue à sauver notre planète. Tous ces conseils impliquent simplement quelques changements à nos habitudes quotidiennes.

Marchez et limitez l'utilisation de votre voiture. L'une des images emblématiques de la pollution est celle de nos véhicules. Ils brûlent du carburant. Ils ne sont pas aussi efficaces que nous le souhaiterions, et nous les utilisons chaque jour. Pour atténuer les effets de la pollution atmosphérique causée par nos véhicules, nous devrions limiter leur utilisation. Si nous pouvons nous rendre à destination à pied, alors faisons-le. Non seulement nous réduisons nos émissions de dioxyde de carbone, mais nous faisons aussi de l'exercice.

Utilisez un ordinateur portable au lieu d'un ordinateur de bureau. Les ordinateurs portables sont plus économes en énergie que leurs homologues plus gros. Un ordinateur portable est généralement 50% plus efficace en termes de consommation d'électricité. En plus de cela, l'ordinateur portable présente d'autres avantages. Il est portable, ce qui vous permet de travailler où vous le souhaitez, et il offre des fonctionnalités puissantes sans la grande taille des unités de bureau.

Fermez le robinet pendant que vous vous brossez les dents. Il est toujours préférable d'utiliser un verre lorsque nous nous brossons les dents et de ne pas laisser le robinet couler en continu. Ainsi, nous gaspillons moins d'eau pendant que nous nettoyons nos perles blanches. Il suffit de fermer le robinet lorsque vous ne l'utilisez pas.

Utilisez au maximum la lumière naturelle. Nous avons une lampe formidable et naturelle : le soleil. Nous devrions apprendre à en profiter pleinement pendant la journée. Donc, au lieu d'allumer nos lumières ou nos lampes même s'il n'est pas encore le soir, nous devrions tirer les rideaux et laisser la lumière naturelle entrer par les fenêtres.

Ce ne sont là que quelques-uns des meilleurs conseils pour une vie écologique, mais bien sûr, il existe encore de nombreux autres conseils si vous les recherchez. Mais vous pouvez créer votre propre variante à tout moment, en priorisant toujours la manière dont vous pouvez utiliser moins d'énergie et produire encore moins de déchets et de pollution.

"Les Américains aiment visiter les parcs nationaux. En 1996, plus de 250 000 000 personnes ont visité des zones gérées par le National Park Service. Les experts affirment que d'ici 2012, 500 000 000 personnes par an visiteront les parcs. Par conséquent, les gens essaient de trouver des moyens de protéger les parcs des foules.

La surpopulation des parcs a provoqué plusieurs problèmes. L'un d'eux est qu'il n'y a pas assez d'espace pour toutes les personnes qui souhaitent utiliser les parcs. Pour faire face à ce problème, vous devrez peut-être réserver vos billets quelques mois à l'avance. Le Park Service peut également augmenter les frais d'entrée.

Un autre problème causé par l'utilisation accrue des parcs est la pollution. Certains déchets et déchets peuvent être nettoyés, et le nettoyage peut être payé par une augmentation des frais d'entrée. Pour réduire la pollution sonore et la pollution atmosphérique, le nombre de voitures autorisées dans les parcs peut être limité. Si cela se produit, les gens peuvent utiliser des bus pour se déplacer dans les parcs. Les fonctionnaires peuvent également limiter l'utilisation des jet-skis, des motoneiges, des bateaux à moteur et des hélicoptères et avions de tourisme.

Les parcs peuvent également être en danger en raison du développement qui se poursuit autour d'eux. Par exemple, autour du parc de Yellowstone, de nombreux hôtels, terrains de golf, stations balnéaires et autres attractions touristiques ont été construits. Certains de ces développements ont des effets sur les zones utilisées par les animaux. Les gens devront apprendre à s'entendre sur des moyens de protéger les parcs. S'ils ne le font pas, il n'y aura bientôt plus aucune raison de visiter ces trésors nationaux.

"Le journaliste : Comment ""Cheval de Guerre"" est-il devenu un tel succès ?

Michael : ""Cheval de Guerre"" a été publié en 1982 et ne s'est pas très bien vendu. Mais mes éditeurs l'ont gardé en librairie, ainsi que tous mes livres. Je suis très reconnaissant envers Egmont et je suis sûr qu'ils sont maintenant très reconnaissants envers eux-mêmes.

Le livre a été découvert 21 ans plus tard, par accident. J'étais sur ""Desert Island Discs"" sur Radio 4 en 2003 lorsque mon travail est devenu plus connu. L'une des auditrices était la mère d'un metteur en scène appelé Tom Morris, et après avoir lu ""Cheval de Guerre"" elle-même, elle a dit à son fils de le lire. Deux ans plus tard, la pièce est sortie et a été un énorme succès qui s'est joué au West End, à Broadway et maintenant au Canada et en Australie, puis en tournée américaine nationale en juin de cette année.

En 2009, Kathy Kennedy, la productrice qui a travaillé avec Steven Spielberg, est entrée au New London Theatre pour voir la pièce parce que sa fille l'aimait beaucoup. Elle a ensuite téléphoné à Spielberg et lui a dit que ce serait son prochain film ! La façon dont tout s'est passé est meilleure que toutes mes histoires. ""Cheval de Guerre"" s'est maintenant vendu à plus d'un million d'exemplaires.

Le journaliste : ""Cheval de Guerre"" a-t-il changé votre vie ?

Michael : Il a fait toute la différence au monde. Le cadeau le plus important qu'il nous ait offert est de ne pas avoir à nous soucier de l'argent, car il y a toujours eu une légère anxiété. Il nous a permis de garantir l'éducation de nos petits-enfants. Il y a aussi un inconvénient, qui est de supposer que je suis super riche. Je ne le suis pas, en réalité. C'est très agréable et complètement inattendu, mais je dois continuer à écrire. Si j'étais plus jeune, je pense que cela me monterait à la tête.

"Le Championnat du Monde de Portage de Femmes est célébré dans une petite ville du centre de la Finlande depuis 1992. En 1992, les habitants de la ville ont décidé de relancer des traditions oubliées. À la fin du XIXe siècle, un voleur appelé Rosvo-Ronkainen sévissait dans la région. On disait qu'il n'acceptait que les hommes qui prouvaient leur valeur dans des défis comme membres de son gang. À cette époque, il était également courant de voler des femmes dans les villages voisins.

Cet événement est de plus en plus populaire. Chaque année, un grand nombre de concurrents, de personnes et de journalistes de la Finlande au Canada assistent au Championnat du Monde de Portage de Femmes.

L'événement est réputé pour son ambiance chaleureuse et humoristique. Le Championnat du Monde de Portage de Femmes se déroule sur un parcours officiel de 253,3 mètres de long. Le parcours comporte deux obstacles secs et un obstacle aquatique d'environ un mètre de profondeur.

Il existe quelques règles de base et le couple qui termine le parcours dans le temps le plus court remporte la victoire. La femme à porter peut être la vôtre ou celle de votre voisin. Le poids minimum de la femme à porter est de 49 kg. Si elle pèse moins de 49 kg, on lui donnera un sac lourd à porter. Chaque fois qu'un concurrent laisse tomber sa femme, le couple est pénalisé de 15 secondes.

Parallèlement au Championnat du Monde de Portage de Femmes, il y a également une compétition par équipes. La distance est la même, mais trois hommes de l'équipe portent la femme à tour de rôle. Au point d'échange, le porteur doit boire une « boisson de portage de femme » officielle. Il peut alors poursuivre la course. Un prix spécial est décerné à l'équipe ayant les meilleurs costumes.

Pendant la tenue du Championnat du Monde de Portage de Femmes, des groupes de musique jouent, il y a une danse de portage de femmes et d'autres formes de divertissement.

Les Asiatiques sont différents de toutes les autres cultures. Si vous pensez les connaître, vous devriez peut-être y repenser. En quoi sont-ils différents ? Dans la plupart des cultures asiatiques, le respect est primordial. Vous pouvez faire tout ce que vous voulez, mais ne manquez pas de respect à un homme asiatique.

"Lonely Planet Publications est le plus grand éditeur de guides de voyage au monde. Avec plus de 650 titres vendus dans 118 pays, il vend six millions d'exemplaires par an, guidant les voyageurs dans des lieux du monde entier.

Tony Wheeler et sa femme Maureen Wheeler ont été les fondateurs de Lonely Planet Publications et ses premiers auteurs. Ils ont réalisé la première publication de Lonely Planet - Across Asia on the Cheap. Originaire d'Australie, le couple avait décidé de voyager de l'Europe vers sa maison en Australie par voie terrestre, en traversant les pays d'Iran, d'Afghanistan, du Pakistan, de l'Inde, du Népal et de l'Asie du Sud-Est, pour finalement atteindre l'Australie. Les infrastructures touristiques étaient limitées dans ces pays, donc si les voyageurs voulaient s'y rendre, ils devaient manger et dormir localement. Nombre de ces voyageurs étaient jeunes et aventureux, mais ils n'avaient pas beaucoup d'argent, donc le fait de s'intégrer à la population locale était le seul moyen pour eux de se permettre de voyager à travers l'Asie. Frustrés par l'absence de guide touristique pour fournir aux voyageurs à petit budget des informations sur l'hébergement, la nourriture et le transport dans ces régions, les Wheeler ont décidé d'écrire eux-mêmes un guide. Plein d'humour et d'opinions fortes, le livre est devenu célèbre parmi les routards - voyageurs à petit budget - comme le principal guide de voyage pour l'Asie. Il a rapporté suffisamment d'argent aux Wheeler pour voyager davantage et financer leur deuxième livre sur les voyages en Asie du Sud-Est à petit budget.

Ce deuxième livre est devenu encore plus populaire et a gagné des lecteurs en dehors de l'Australie, en Amérique du Nord, en Europe et en Nouvelle-Zélande. Les ventes se sont si bien développées que les Wheeler ont pu ouvrir une maison d'édition en Australie, et ont finalement ouvert des bureaux aux États-Unis et en Europe. Parce que les guides étaient basés sur les expériences des auteurs contributeurs, le contenu était frais et à jour. Au fur et à mesure que de plus en plus de livres étaient écrits, la série en est finalement venue à couvrir tous les pays du monde.

"Nous utilisons des mots de passe pour garder nos informations personnelles secrètes et en sécurité, mais certains mots de passe que nous utilisons peuvent ne pas être aussi fiables que nous le pensons. Splash Data, une société de sécurité informatique, a récemment publié une liste des 25 pires mots de passe de 2011. Cette liste est basée sur la recherche de fichiers contenant des mots de passe volés. Selon la liste, « mot de passe » est le pire mot de passe et le plus courant. De nombreux autres mots de passe de la liste sont des chiffres dans l'ordre, soit vers l'avant (par exemple, 1234) soit vers l'arrière. Les lettres du clavier dans l'ordre, telles que « qwerty », sont également courantes, ainsi que certains prénoms et animaux. « Les pirates informatiques peuvent facilement pénétrer dans de nombreux comptes simplement en essayant des mots de passe courants encore et encore », a déclaré Morgan Slain, PDG de Splash Data. Comment pouvez-vous créer un mot de passe fort ? Il doit comporter huit caractères ou plus, avec un mélange de lettres, de chiffres et de symboles. Une façon de créer un mot de passe long et facile à retenir est de séparer les mots courts par des espaces ou des chiffres. Avoir des mots de passe sûrs est nécessaire pour surfer sur Internet en toute sécurité. Mais ce n'est pas la seule chose que vous devez faire pour assurer votre sécurité en ligne. Voici d'autres conseils de sécurité sur le Web :

L'objectif peut être d'obtenir un arbre de la bonne hauteur, tout en favorisant la croissance de petites branches latérales qui épaissiront son apparence ou lui donneront une forme particulière.

Deuxièmement, la taille peut être effectuée pour rendre l'arbre plus sain. Vous pouvez couper le bois malade ou mort, ou les branches qui se frottent les unes aux autres et provoquent ainsi des blessures. La santé d'un arbre peut être encouragée en éliminant les branches qui obstruent le centre et empêchent ainsi la libre circulation de l'air.

L'une des conséquences de la taille est qu'une plaie ouverte est laissée sur l'arbre, ce qui facilite l'entrée des maladies. Cependant, c'est une plaie qui guérira. Souvent, il y a une course entre la guérison et la maladie pour savoir si l'arbre survivra ou mourra. Chaque jardinier doit s'efforcer de réduire le risque autant que possible. Il est nécessaire de rendre la zone qui a été taillée lisse et propre, car la rugosité ralentira la guérison. Vous devez laisser la surface coupée sécher pendant quelques heures et ensuite la peindre avec l'une des substances disponibles dans les magasins de jardinage, spécialement conçues à cet effet.

La taille se fait généralement en hiver. À cette période de l'année, vous pouvez voir clairement la forme de l'arbre et il est également très peu probable que les coupes que vous effectuez saignent. Si cela se produit, il est bien sûr impossible de les peindre correctement.

"Lorsque j'étais en deuxième année, mon professeur a donné des graines à tous ses élèves. Elle nous a dit d'observer la magie des graines une fois que nous les aurions plantées. Excitée, j'ai mis quelques graines dans mon pot. Je les ai arrosées pendant quelques jours et des fleurs violettes sont apparues.

En classe, j'ai rapporté à mon professeur que la magie était les fleurs violettes. Mes camarades de classe ont rapporté des fleurs rouges, blanches ou jaunes. Je me demandais pourquoi nous n'avions pas de fleurs vertes. Lorsque la cloche a sonné, nous avons tiré une conclusion ""un jardin de fleurs est magnifique"", et ce fut ma première expérience de jardinage.

Des années plus tard, un jour, alors que nous passions en voiture devant le centre-ville de Naperville en été. Maman a désigné un grand terrain. ""Regarde, c'est le terrain du jardin communautaire,"" m'a-t-elle dit. ""Qu'est-ce qu'un jardin communautaire ?"" ai-je demandé. ""Quand les gens vivent dans des appartements ou des maisons en rangée, ils n'ont pas beaucoup de terrain. Les gens paient un peu d'argent pour louer un morceau de terrain à la ville. Ils peuvent cultiver n'importe quoi."" ""Pourquoi on n'en loue pas un ?"" ai-je demandé avec curiosité. ""On n'en a pas besoin. On a une maison, donc on a un petit morceau de terrain.""

Il y a quelques années, un couple âgé a emménagé à côté de chez nous. Ils nous ont donné des tomates de leur jardin. Ils ont cultivé les meilleures tomates que j'aie jamais goûtées. J'ai demandé à ma mère d'acheter des tomates comme celles de nos voisins. Maman a dit qu'il était impossible d'acheter ces tomates au supermarché.

Alors, l'année dernière, j'ai décidé d'essayer. J'ai demandé à mon père de creuser un petit terrain dans la cour arrière de notre maison, d'y mettre de la tourbe et du compost de champignons. Pour commencer, j'ai seulement planté des tomates et des concombres. Jour après jour, j'ai pris soin de mon jardin et j'ai enlevé les mauvaises herbes. J'ai été surprise de voir que les concombres poussaient réellement sur la vigne, et mes tomates avaient une odeur particulière de terre.

En même temps, je me suis soudainement intéressée à la météo. J'ai toujours souhaité qu'il pleuve pour arroser mon petit jardin. Mon frère Alex m'a dit : ""Tu es un vieux fermier maintenant.""

Un jour, j'ai trouvé des tomates disparues sur une plante. J'étais un peu triste. Qui a osé voler mes tomates ? C'était des lapins. Alors que j'allais les chasser, mon père m'a arrêté et m'a dit : ""Alice, les lapins ont soif. Laisse-les manger autant qu'ils veulent. Partager sa nourriture est une bonne chose.""

Plus tard, j'ai trouvé des gens qui cueillaient des tomates dans mon petit jardin et les mangeaient avec un sourire satisfait. Je n'ai rien dit. Au lieu de cela, j'ai ressenti de la joie dans mon cœur. Lorsque la récolte est arrivée, j'ai cueilli de nombreux concombres frais et de délicieuses tomates.

En Amérique, les gens cultivent des jardins partout. L'air est toujours frais et propre grâce aux nombreux arbres, aux différentes plantes et aux belles fleurs. Les gens apprennent à aimer notre terre et à aimer entendre l'expression ""va faire un câlin à un arbre"". Le jardinage demande beaucoup de travail et de patience, mais mère nature nous récompense beaucoup.

"Le papier a été inventé pour la première fois en l'an 105. Il a été fabriqué par un Chinois nommé Cai Lun.
Les Japonais ont découvert le papier vers l'an 600. Au fil des ans, les habitants d'autres régions ont commencé à fabriquer du papier.
Le crayon à papier n'est pas fait de plomb. Il est fait de graphite. Les gens ont trouvé du graphite en 1564. Ils pensaient qu'il s'agissait d'une sorte de plomb. Aujourd'hui, on appelle encore les crayons « crayons à papier ». Les premiers crayons étaient fabriqués en entourant des bâtonnets de graphite de ficelles.
Les premiers crayons en bois ont été fabriqués par Kasper Faber, d'Allemagne, en 1761.
Les gommes à effacer comme celles que nous utilisons aujourd'hui ont été inventées en France par un homme nommé Magellan en 1752. C'est Hyman L. Lipman qui a été le premier à fixer une gomme à effacer à l'extrémité des crayons. Et c'est ainsi que les crayons sont devenus ce qu'ils sont.

"Selon une étude récente menée par l'Office of Applied Science, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, environ 3 900 enfants et adolescents de moins de 18 ans essaient leur première cigarette chaque jour. Parmi les adolescents qui continuent de fumer à l'âge adulte, environ un sur trois mourra des suites de cette habitude.

En raison de la teneur en nicotine des produits du tabac, fumer devient non seulement une habitude pour les adolescents, mais aussi une addiction. La nicotine contenue dans le tabac est addictive. Une fois qu'un adolescent a pris l'habitude de fumer, il lui est difficile d'arrêter sans aide. L'American Lung Association signale que les fumeurs qui commencent tôt dans la vie ont plus de difficultés à arrêter en raison de la dépendance.

Les adolescents qui fument le font souvent pour gérer des situations sociales ou sous la pression de leurs pairs. Les résultats d'une étude de l'Université Duke montrent que les adolescents qui ont des frères et sœurs fumeurs sont plus susceptibles de se livrer au tabagisme et à d'autres comportements à risque. Les composants des produits du tabac ont des effets documentés sur le comportement. Il est connu que la nicotine augmente les bagarres chez les adolescents et les adultes.

Le Centre pour la santé des jeunes femmes de l'hôpital pour enfants de Boston indique que les produits du tabac contiennent environ 4 000 produits chimiques, dont certains sont toxiques. Respirer ces poisons dans les poumons affecte rapidement tout le corps d'un adolescent. Les changements externes incluent une peau sèche et ridée, des dents et des ongles jaunes et une mauvaise haleine. Les adolescents fumeurs sont trois fois plus susceptibles d'avoir de mauvaises dents que les non-fumeurs de leur âge, poursuit le Centre. Les effets externes sont souvent présents peu de temps après que le tabagisme est devenu une habitude.

"À l'aube du vendredi 19 mai 1780, les fermiers de la Nouvelle-Angleterre s'arrêtèrent pour s'émerveiller de la couleur rose du soleil. Vers midi, le ciel s'était obscurci jusqu'à une noirceur de minuit, ce qui a provoqué chez les Américains, encore en plein effort douloureux dans une guerre d'indépendance prolongée, l'allumage de bougies et des frissons à la pensée du Jugement dernier. Alors que les oiseaux se taisaient et qu'aucune tempête n'accompagnait l'obscurité, les hommes et les femmes se sont massés dans les églises, où un ministre a commenté que ""les gens étaient très attentifs"". John Greenleaf Whittier a écrit plus tard que ""Les hommes priaient, et les femmes pleuraient ; toutes les oreilles étaient tendues...""

Une étude récente de chercheurs, dirigée par Richard Guyette du Tree Ring Laboratory de l'Université du Missouri, a montré que de vastes incendies de forêt dans les Hautes-terres algonquines du sud de l'Ontario et ailleurs au Canada ont provoqué cet événement en Nouvelle-Angleterre. Les scientifiques ont découvert des ""cicatrices de feu"" sur les anneaux de cette année, laissées lorsque la chaleur d'un incendie de forêt a tué une partie du cambium d'un arbre. Des preuves recueillies indiquent également une sécheresse cette année-là. Un vent d'est et une faible pression barométrique ont contribué à faire pénétrer la fumée dans la haute atmosphère. ""Le dossier correspond assez bien"", explique Guyette. ""Nous avions le bon combustible, la sécheresse. Les conditions étaient réunies.""

Manquant de la possibilité de communiquer rapidement sur de longues distances, les Américains de 1780 sont restés dans l'ignorance de l'événement, qui avait disparu le lendemain. Au cours des mois suivants, les journaux ont publié des débats houleux sur ce qui avait provoqué les ténèbres. Certaines voix étaient celles de prédictions en colère, comme celle d'un fermier du Massachusetts qui a écrit : ""Oh ! Nouvelle-Angleterre retombée dans le péché, réfléchissez maintenant aux choses qui appartiennent à votre paix avant qu'elles ne soient à jamais cachées à vos yeux."" D'autres ont donné des réponses différentes. L'un d'eux a déclaré qu'une ""étoile flamboyante"" était passée entre la terre et le soleil. Des cendres, a avancé un autre commentateur. Le débat, mené dans toute la Nouvelle-Angleterre, où il n'existait pas encore de revues scientifiques ni d'académies, reflétait une culture naissante de l'enquête scientifique qui balayait déjà le monde occidental, une révolution presque aussi influente que la guerre d'indépendance contre les Anglais.

Les Néo-anglais n'oublieront pas de sitôt cette journée sombre ; elle a perduré dans le folklore, les poèmes et les sermons pendant des générations.

"Peter Onruang, un homme d'affaires hollywoodien, a payé 310 000 dollars pour cloner son meilleur ami Wolfie, un adorable chien. Il a déclaré : ""Wolfie était plus qu'un simple animal de compagnie pour moi."" Wolfie est décédée il y a deux ans, à l'âge de 15 ans. Mais longtemps avant que Wolfie et sa sœur Bubble ne meurent, Onruang avait déjà prévu de les ramener à la vie. Onruang a déclaré : ""Je les ai enterrées à la maison. Chaque fois que je vais les voir, je dis : 'Salut, je suis en train de vous créer un nouveau corps.'""
Finalement, Onruang a trouvé l'entreprise sud-coréenne de biotechnologie RNL Bio, qui peut et va cloner des animaux. Onruang a prélevé des cellules souches de ses chiens, puis il a lancé un site web, MyFriendAgain.com, afin de pouvoir gagner et économiser les 310 000 dollars que coûterait le clonage.
Les nouveaux chiens devraient être identiques à Wolfie et Bubble. Une fois le processus de clonage terminé, Onruang pourrait se retrouver avec plusieurs clones de chaque chien. Mais Onruang admet qu'il n'est toujours pas sûr qu'ils seront exactement les mêmes.
Les scientifiques ont cloné le premier animal, une brebis nommée Dolly, en 1996 en Écosse. Ce projet a soulevé des questions éthiques quant à la limite à laquelle la science devrait s'arrêter. Une autre question est de savoir si une telle technique conduira un jour à la possibilité de cloner des humains.
""Si j'avais l'occasion de me cloner, je le ferais sans hésiter"", a déclaré Onruang. ""Parce que c'est moi, c'est moi que je fais grandir. Je connais déjà mes forces et mes faiblesses. Cette personne sera la nouvelle et améliorée version de moi, et vivra la vie que j'ai toujours voulu vivre.""

"##  La Vallée de Patapsco : Un Parc d'État au Maryland

**Faune et Nature**

En visitant le Parc d'État de la Vallée de Patapsco, vous découvrirez une variété d'habitats naturels. Au printemps et en automne, les cornouillers, les érables, les arbres aux fleurs roses et une multitude de fleurs sauvages colorent la forêt. Ce parc abrite également de nombreux petits mammifères et oiseaux. Si vous vous arrêtez un instant pendant votre promenade dans la forêt, vous verrez probablement des lapins, des écureuils gris et des renards roux. Le long des rives de la rivière, les ornithologues observeront des oies du Canada et des canards boisés toute l'année.

**Pêche**

La rivière Patapsco serpente à travers le parc et est une attraction populaire pour les pêcheurs. Le Service de la Pêche du Département des Ressources Naturelles classe la rivière comme une pêcherie de type ""mise à l'eau et remise à l'eau"", avec des truites arc-en-ciel et brunes adultes au printemps et en automne. Les pêcheurs apprécient également la capture de l'achigan à petite bouche et à grande bouche, de la perche soleil, du crapet-soleil et de la perchaude qui se reproduisent naturellement.

Des zones de pêche ont été spécialement aménagées au Lac Perdu pour les jeunes de moins de 16 ans et les seniors de 62 ans et plus. Cette zone est également conçue pour les pêcheurs en situation de handicap.

**Sentiers**

Les amateurs d'aventure apprécieront la randonnée, le vélo de montagne et l'équitation sur le réseau de sentiers populaire du parc. Plus de 17 miles de sentiers uniques, difficiles et accidentés suivent les crêtes, les pentes raides et les vallées fluviales du parc. Ces sentiers sont également d'excellents points de départ pour l'observation de la faune, l'observation des oiseaux et l'appréciation générale de la nature. Veuillez respecter les droits des propriétaires fonciers privés à proximité en utilisant uniquement les sentiers balisés. N'oubliez pas que le parc est une zone naturelle comportant certains dangers, tels que le sumac vénéneux, les surfaces de sentiers glissantes, les insectes, etc. Vous êtes responsable d'avoir les compétences, les connaissances et l'équipement nécessaires pour une visite en toute sécurité.

**Découvrez l'Histoire le long du Sentier**

Entrez dans un autre temps en explorant les sentiers de Patapsco. Couche après couche d'histoire raconte l'interaction de l'homme avec la nature. Les Amérindiens ont chassé, cueilli et pêché ici pendant des siècles. Dans les années 1700, la vallée est devenue l'un des premiers sites de la Révolution industrielle américaine. Les premiers colons ont abattu des arbres pour obtenir du charbon de bois utilisé pour alimenter les hauts fourneaux. Le courant de la rivière a été endigué et canalisé pour alimenter des usines de fer, de papier, de céréales et de textiles. Des villes et des fermes de tabac ont été établies dans toute la vallée.

"Une grande partie de mon travail de coach consiste à aider les gens à prendre des décisions importantes, comme ""Si je suis à un carrefour dans ma carrière, quelle voie dois-je suivre ?"" ou ""Si j'envisage plusieurs offres, laquelle dois-je accepter ?""

Ces décisions difficiles me rappellent une remarque faite par Scott McNealy, PDG de Sun Microsystems pendant de nombreuses années, lors d'une conférence à laquelle j'assistais à l'école de commerce de Stanford. Il avait été interrogé sur la façon dont il prenait des décisions et avait répondu : ""Il est important de prendre de bonnes décisions. Je passe beaucoup moins de temps et d'énergie à m'inquiéter de prendre la bonne décision et beaucoup plus d'énergie à m'assurer que toute décision que je prends se révèle être la bonne.""

En fait, avant de prendre une décision, en particulier une décision difficile, nous sommes anxieux et nous concentrons sur l'identification de la ""meilleure"" option en raison du risque de se ""tromper"". Mais un effet secondaire de cet état d'esprit est que nous accordons trop d'attention au moment du choix et que nous perdons de vue tout ce qui suit. Ce qui se passe ensuite est ce qui détermine finalement si une décision était ""juste"".

Un autre aspect de cet état d'esprit est que notre concentration sur la prise de la ""bonne"" décision peut facilement conduire à la paralysie (,), car les options parmi lesquelles nous choisissons sont tellement difficiles à classer en premier lieu. Comment pouvons-nous déterminer de manière définitive à l'avance quelle carrière sera la ""meilleure"", ou quelle offre d'emploi nous devrions accepter ? Évidemment, nous ne le pouvons pas.

Se concentrer sur l'effort après notre décision nous aide non seulement à réussir, mais nous rappelle également que nous jouons un rôle dans chaque résultat. Notre contrôle doit se trouver dans nos activités quotidiennes plutôt que dans notre décision unique.

Nous nous sommes accordé le droit de faire du bruit. Mais qu'en est-il de nos responsabilités ? Avons-nous développé un sens de la responsabilité acoustique ?

Les preuves suggèrent que non. De nombreuses personnes semblent croire qu'elles ont un droit illimité de faire du bruit avec les voitures et les motos, et avec la musique forte à la maison et dans la rue. Dans certains pays, des mesures ont été prises pour obliger les gens à faire moins de bruit. En Grande-Bretagne, par exemple, une loi a été adoptée pour empêcher les gens de déranger leurs voisins avec de la musique la nuit.

Il est largement admis que nous devons gérer nos déchets de manière responsable. Le bruit est en réalité une forme de déchet particulièrement insidieuse. Il détruit la vie communautaire, nous poursuit jusqu'à nos foyers, nous empêche de dormir et est à l'origine de nombreuses maladies liées au stress, ainsi que de pertes auditives.

Plus tard, elle s'envola pour le Zimbabwe où elle parla à un éléphant et apprit que les fermiers ne les chassaient plus. C'est parce que le gouvernement avait décidé de les aider et que les fermiers avaient finalement gagné beaucoup d'argent. 

Enfin, elle arriva dans la forêt tropicale épaisse où un singe lui dit : ""Pas de forêt tropicale, pas d'animaux et pas de médicaments."" Même si tout était finalement parti, elle avait beaucoup appris.

"Un an après l'obtention de mon diplôme, on m'a offert un poste d'enseignement d'un cours d'écriture. L'enseignement était une profession que je n'avais jamais sérieusement envisagée, bien que plusieurs de mes histoires aient été publiées. J'ai accepté le poste sans hésiter, car il me permettrait de porter une cravate et de me faire appeler M. Davis. Mon père portait le même nom, et j'aimais imaginer que les gens nous confondraient. ""Attendez une minute"", dirait quelqu'un, ""parlez-vous de M. Davis, l'homme à la retraite, ou de M. Davis, le savant respectable ?""

Le poste m'a été offert à la dernière minute, et j'ai eu deux semaines pour me préparer, une période que j'ai passée à chercher une mallette et à me tenir devant mon miroir de corps entier, répétant les mots ""Bonjour la classe. Je suis M. Davis."" Parfois, je me donnais une voix agressive. Parfois, je faisais semblant d'avoir de l'expérience. Mais quand le jour est arrivé, mes nerfs ont cédé et le vrai M. Davis était là. Je ne ressemblais pas à un professeur réfléchi, mais plutôt à un garçon de 12 ans.

Je suis arrivé en classe avec des cartes en papier en forme de feuilles d'érable. Je les avais découpées moi-même dans du papier construction orange. J'ai vu neuf élèves autour d'une longue table. J'ai distribué les cartes, et les élèves ont écrit leurs noms et les ont attachées à leur poche de poitrine comme je l'avais demandé.

""Alors voilà"", ai-je dit. ""Ok, c'est parti."" Puis j'ai ouvert ma mallette et j'ai réalisé que je n'avais jamais réfléchi au-delà de ce moment. J'avais pensé que les élèves seraient les premiers à parler, offrant leurs pensées et opinions sur les événements de la journée. J'avais imaginé que je m'assiérais au bord du bureau, surplombant une forêt de mains. Chaque élève crierait. ""Calmez-vous, vous aurez tous votre tour. Un à la fois, un à la fois !""

Un silence terrible régnait dans la pièce, et ne voyant pas d'autres opinions, j'ai inspecté les élèves pour leur demander de sortir leurs cahiers et d'écrire une brève dissertation sur le thème de la profonde déception.

"Il a été constaté que moins d'un client sur cinq établit une liste de courses complète avant d'aller au magasin. La raison en est que sept achats sur dix sont décidés en magasin, où les clients ont tendance à acheter sur un coup de tête. Les achats d'épicerie impulsifs ont augmenté au cours des quarante dernières années, et cette augmentation a coïncidé avec la croissance des achats en libre-service. Cependant, dans les épiceries où des employés attendent les clients, il y a beaucoup moins d'achats impulsifs. Il est difficile pour les gens d'acheter sur un coup de tête s'ils doivent s'adresser à un employé.
Les psychologues se sont alliés aux experts en merchandising. Leur travail consiste à persuader les gens d'acheter des produits dont ils n'ont peut-être pas besoin ou qu'ils ne veulent même pas avant de les voir présentés de manière attrayante. Les psychologues ont découvert que les acheteurs souhaitent être guidés dans leurs achats. Avoir autant de choix les déroute, et ils préfèrent l'emballage qui les attire. Par conséquent, il est maintenant plus courant que les emballeurs de nourriture accordent une attention particulière à la conception de leur emballage. L'attrait dépend fortement de la position du produit sur l'étagère, cependant. Ainsi, il est plus facile de persuader le client d'acheter si le produit est situé au niveau des yeux.

"Il y a quelques jours, j'ai demandé à Julia, la gouvernante de mes fils, de venir dans mon bureau. ""Assieds-toi, Julia"", lui ai-je dit, ""Réglons nos comptes. Je suppose que tu as probablement besoin d'argent, mais peut-être es-tu trop polie pour le mentionner. Alors, nous nous sommes mis d'accord sur trente dollars par mois...""

""Quarante.""

""Non, trente. J'en ai pris note. Je paie toujours trente dollars à notre gouvernante. Eh bien, tu es ici depuis deux mois, alors...""

""Deux mois et cinq jours.""

""Exactement deux mois. J'en ai fait une note spéciale. Cela signifie que tu as soixante dollars à recevoir. Retire neuf dimanches... tu sais que tu ne travaillais pas avec Tom les dimanches, tu ne faisais que te promener. Et trois jours fériés..."" Julia se rongeait l'ongle nerveusement, son visage était rouge, mais - pas un mot.

""Trois jours fériés, donc retire douze dollars. Quatre jours où Tom était malade et où il n'y avait pas de cours, car tu ne t'occupais que de Dick. Trois jours où tu avais mal aux dents et où ma femme t'a donné la permission de ne pas travailler après le déjeuner. Douze et sept - dix-neuf. Retire dix-neuf... il reste... hmm... quarante et un dollars. Correct ?""

L'œil gauche de Julia rougit, les larmes lui montaient aux yeux. Son menton tremblait ; elle toussa nerveusement et se moucha, mais - toujours pas un mot.

""Autour du jour de l'an, tu as cassé une tasse à thé et une soucoupe ; retire deux dollars. La tasse coûtait plus cher, c'était un trésor de famille, mais - oublie ça. Quand est-ce que je n'ai pas subi une perte ! Ensuite, à cause de ton négligence, Tom a grimpé à un arbre et a déchiré sa veste ; retire dix. Egalement à cause de ton imprudence, la femme de chambre a volé les chaussures de Dick. Tu devrais tout surveiller ! Tu es payée pour ça. Donc, cela signifie encore cinq dollars de moins. Le dix janvier, je t'ai donné dix dollars.""

""Tu ne l'as pas fait."" sanglota Julia.

""Mais j'en ai pris note.""

""Eh bien... si tu le dis.""

""Retire vingt-sept de quarante et un - il reste quatorze.""

Ses deux yeux étaient remplis de larmes. Des gouttes de sueur perlaient sur son petit nez fin et joli. Pauvre fille !

""Je n'ai reçu de l'argent qu'une seule fois"", murmura-t-elle, la voix tremblante, ""et c'était par ta femme. Trois dollars, pas plus.""

""Vraiment ? Tu vois maintenant, et je ne le savais pas ! Retire trois de quatorze... il reste onze. Voici ton argent, ma chère. Trois, trois, trois, un et un. Le voilà !""

Je lui ai remis onze dollars. Elle les a pris et les a mis dans sa poche.

""Merci (: )"", murmura-t-elle.

J'ai sauté sur mes pieds et j'ai commencé à parcourir la pièce. J'étais submergé par la colère. ""Pour quoi, ce - 'merci' ?"" ai-je demandé.

""Pour l'argent.""

""Mais tu sais que je t'ai trompée - volée ! Je t'ai en fait volée ! Pourquoi ce 'merci' ?""

""Dans mes autres endroits, on ne me donnait rien du tout.""

""Ils ne t'ont rien donné ? Pas étonnant ! Je t'ai joué un petit tour, une leçon cruelle, juste pour t'apprendre... Je vais te donner les quatre-vingts dollars ! Les voilà dans l'enveloppe, prêts pour toi... Est-il vraiment possible d'être aussi sans colonne vertébrale ? Pourquoi n'as-tu pas protesté ? Pourquoi es-tu restée silencieuse ? Est-il possible dans ce monde d'être sans dents ni griffes - d'être un tel imbécile ?""

Embarrassée, elle a souri. Et j'ai pu lire son expression, ""C'est possible.""

Je lui ai demandé pardon pour la leçon cruelle et, à sa grande surprise, je lui ai donné les quatre-vingts dollars. Elle a murmuré son petit ""merci"" plusieurs fois et est sortie. Je l'ai regardée partir et j'ai pensé, ""Comme il est facile d'écraser les faibles dans ce monde !""

"Tout comme les organismes scientifiques les plus respectés au monde ont confirmé que la planète se réchauffe, ils ont également déclaré qu'il existe des preuves solides que les humains sont à l'origine de ce réchauffement. D'innombrables rapports récents des principales institutions scientifiques du monde ont affirmé la même chose. Par exemple, un résumé de la science du climat de 2010 par la Royal Society a déclaré : « Il existe des preuves solides que le réchauffement de la Terre au cours des cinquante dernières années a été causé en grande partie par l'activité humaine. »

L'idée que les humains puissent modifier le climat de la planète peut sembler contre-intuitive, mais la science de base est bien comprise. Chaque année, l'activité humaine provoque le rejet de milliards de tonnes de gaz à effet de serre dans l'atmosphère. Comme les scientifiques le savent depuis des années, ces gaz retiennent la chaleur qui s'échapperait autrement dans l'espace, enveloppant la planète d'une couverture invisible.

Bien sûr, le climat de la planète a toujours changé en raison de facteurs « naturels » tels que les variations de l'activité solaire ou volcanique, ou les cycles liés à la rotation de la Terre autour du soleil. Selon la littérature scientifique, cependant, le réchauffement enregistré à ce jour correspond au schéma de réchauffement que l'on attendrait d'une accumulation de gaz à effet de serre dans l'atmosphère, et non au réchauffement que l'on attendrait d'autres causes possibles.

Même si les scientifiques découvraient une autre explication plausible au réchauffement observé jusqu'à présent, cela soulèverait une question difficile. Comme l'écrit Robert Henson dans The Rough Guide to Climate Change : « Si un facteur nouvellement découvert peut expliquer le changement climatique, pourquoi le dioxyde de carbone et les autres gaz à effet de serre ne produisent-ils pas le réchauffement que la physique de base nous dit qu'ils devraient produire ? »

La seule façon de prouver avec une certitude absolue que les humains sont responsables du réchauffement climatique serait de mener une expérience avec deux Terres, l'une avec l'influence humaine et l'autre sans. Cela n'est évidemment pas possible, et la plupart des scientifiques prennent soin de ne pas affirmer avec certitude l'influence humaine.

"Nous savons depuis longtemps que les fleurs de différentes plantes s'ouvrent et se ferment à des moments différents de la journée. Pourtant, personne ne comprend vraiment pourquoi les fleurs s'ouvrent et se ferment de cette façon à des moments précis. Ce n'est pas aussi simple qu'on pourrait le penser, comme le montrent de nouvelles expériences. Dans une expérience, des fleurs ont été maintenues dans l'obscurité. On pourrait s'attendre à ce que les fleurs, sans aucune information sur l'heure du jour, ne s'ouvrent pas comme d'habitude. En fait, elles ont continué à s'ouvrir à leur heure habituelle. Cela montre qu'elles ont une façon mystérieuse de connaître le temps.

Leur sens du temps ne dépend pas d'informations provenant du monde extérieur ; il est, pour ainsi dire, en elles, une sorte de ""horloge interne"". Cette découverte peut ne pas sembler très importante. Cependant, il a été constaté plus tard que non seulement les plantes, mais aussi les animaux, y compris l'homme, possèdent cette ""horloge interne"" qui contrôle le fonctionnement de leur corps et leurs activités.

Les êtres humains, par conséquent, sont également contrôlés par ce pouvoir mystérieux. Que nous le voulions ou non, il affecte des choses telles que notre besoin de sommeil, notre besoin de nourriture et notre capacité à nous concentrer.

"Cher Monsieur Zhu,

Je vous écris à la rubrique ""Teenagers Now"" de votre magazine pour vous demander de l'aide concernant mon fils de 16 ans. Actuellement, il refuse de faire presque tout ce que sa mère et moi lui demandons. Il est notre enfant unique et nous le traitons très bien. Ses grands-parents lui achètent beaucoup de choses, et pourtant il reste impoli avec nous. Il refuse de passer du temps avec nous ou de faire ce que nous lui disons. Parfois, il agit comme s'il ne nous aimait pas du tout.

Maintenant, il refuse de faire ses devoirs, et insiste pour perdre son temps à regarder des DVD et à écouter de la musique étrangère. Je ne comprends pas cette musique, et je ne l'aime pas. Il passe également trop de temps dans les cybercafés, où il joue à des jeux ou discute en ligne. Il gaspille un temps précieux durant cette période importante de sa vie !

Que puis-je faire ? Actuellement, pour éviter de rendre sa mère malheureuse par une dispute, je lui laisse sa liberté. Cependant, je crains que si je continue à le laisser faire ce qu'il veut, il puisse échouer à l'école, ou pire.

Comment puis-je aider mon fils sans nuire à notre relation ?

"Cher Rédacteur en chef,

Je vous écris pour vous demander ce qui est arrivé à notre jeunesse. Ils ne sont pas aussi polis, travailleurs ou intelligents que ma génération. Je vais vous donner deux exemples.

Vendredi dernier, j'ai pris le métro à 9h15. Il était très fréquenté, donc il n'y avait pas de places libres. Il y avait des adolescents assis sur les sièges les plus proches de moi. Je ne comprenais pas pourquoi ils n'étaient pas à l'école. Ils parlaient fort et riaient. Il était difficile de lire mon journal avec tout ce bruit. Une femme enceinte et sa fille sont montées à l'arrêt suivant, avec de nombreux sacs de courses. Je m'attendais à ce que les adolescents les laissent s'asseoir. Ils ont vu la femme mais n'ont rien fait. J'ai dû leur demander de lui céder sa place. Ils l'ont fait à contrecœur, mais m'ont lancé un regard désagréable. Je suis descendu à l'arrêt suivant et j'étais content que les adolescents ne me suivent pas.

Samedi dernier, j'ai dîné chez des amis. J'espérais rencontrer leurs enfants, que je n'avais pas vus depuis dix ans. Pendant le dîner, nous avons commencé à parler de politique mondiale. Il est vite apparu qu'ils ne savaient pas grand-chose. Ils ne pouvaient pas me donner le nom du roi d'Espagne ou du président d'Italie. Tout ce qu'ils connaissaient, c'était Internet et quels chanteurs étaient les plus beaux. À mon époque, les étudiants connaissaient les rois, les reines et les présidents de tous les pays d'Europe.

Je m'inquiète pour l'avenir de l'Allemagne. Comment ces jeunes pourraient-ils devenir des travailleurs et des parents responsables ? Ils traînent à McDonald's après l'école au lieu d'aller à la bibliothèque comme je le faisais à leur âge. Peut-être ont-ils trop d'argent. Peut-être qu'un autre lecteur peut nous donner une idée de ce qu'il faut faire avec cette ""génération perdue"".

"Sigmund Freud fut l'un des premiers scientifiques à mener des recherches sérieuses sur l'esprit. L'esprit est l'ensemble des activités basées dans le cerveau qui impliquent la façon dont nous agissons, pensons, ressentons et raisonnons.
Il utilisait de longues conversations avec des patients et l'étude des rêves pour rechercher les causes des problèmes mentaux et émotionnels. Il a également essayé l'hypnose. Il voulait voir si le fait de mettre les patients dans un état de sommeil pourrait aider à apaiser les esprits troublés. Dans la plupart des cas, il a constaté que les effets n'étaient que temporaires.
Freud a travaillé dur, même si ce qu'il faisait pouvait paraître facile. Sa méthode consistait à s'asseoir avec ses patients et à les écouter parler. Il leur faisait parler de tout ce qui leur passait par la tête. Toutes les idées, les pensées et tout ce qui entrait dans leur esprit devaient être exprimés. Il ne pouvait y avoir aucune retenue due à la peur ou à la culpabilité.
Freud croyait que tous les souvenirs douloureux de l'enfance étaient enfouis dans l'inconscient. Cette partie de l'esprit, disait-il, contient des désirs, des envies et des expériences trop effrayantes pour être reconnues.
Il pensait que si ces souvenirs pouvaient être ramenés à la conscience, le patient ressentirait à nouveau la douleur. Mais cette fois, la personne les vivrait en tant qu'adulte. Le patient les ressentirait, pourrait les examiner et, en cas de succès, les comprendre enfin.
En utilisant cette méthode, raisonnait Freud, la douleur et la pression émotionnelle du passé seraient considérablement affaiblies. Elles perdraient leur emprise sur la santé physique de la personne. Bientôt, le patient irait mieux.
Beaucoup des théories de Freud sur le fonctionnement de l'esprit avaient également de fortes connotations sexuelles. Celles-ci comprenaient ce qu'il considérait comme les sentiments refoulés des fils envers leurs mères et des filles envers leurs pères.
Si ce n'est autre chose, les idées de Freud ont été révolutionnaires. Certaines personnes les ont rejetées. Beaucoup d'autres sont venues à les accepter. Mais personne ne conteste sa grande influence sur la science de la santé mentale.

"Une enseignante de maternelle a décidé de faire jouer un jeu à sa classe. Elle a demandé à chaque enfant d'apporter un sac en plastique contenant quelques pommes de terre. Chaque pomme de terre devait être nommée d'après une personne que l'enfant détestait, le nombre de pommes de terre qu'un enfant mettait dans son sac dépendant du nombre de personnes qu'il ne pouvait pas pardonner.
Le jour venu, chaque enfant a apporté des pommes de terre avec les noms des personnes qu'il détestait. Certains en avaient 2, d'autres 3, et certains en avaient jusqu'à 5.

"Les experts ne savent pas vraiment quand les gens ont commencé à garder des poissons comme animaux de compagnie. Mais ils disent que les gens s'intéressent aux poissons depuis des milliers d'années. Certains disent que les anciens Sumériens ont été la première civilisation à garder des poissons dans des étangs il y a plus de quatre mille ans. Les Chinois ont élevé et étudié les carpes et les poissons rouges il y a plus d'un millier d'années. Les anciens Romains gardaient des anguilles comme animaux de compagnie. Et le philosophe grec Aristote a réalisé ce que l'on croit être la première étude connue de la vie marine, y compris les requins et les dauphins.

Garder des poissons à la maison dans de petits réservoirs d'eau appelés _ est extrêmement populaire aujourd'hui. Et tout le monde semble apprécier la visite des grands aquariums publics qui ont ouvert leurs portes dans le monde entier.

Au milieu des années 1800, la science avait montré que les plantes, les poissons et autres créatures marines pouvaient survivre ensemble sous l'eau. Il n'était donc plus nécessaire de changer l'eau d'un réservoir pour que les poissons puissent y vivre. Cela a conduit à la construction des premiers aquariums publics.

Les premiers aquariums ont ouvert à Londres, en Angleterre, en 1853. Au cours des quinze années suivantes, d'autres aquariums ont ouvert leurs portes en Europe et aux États-Unis. En 1928, il y avait environ quarante-cinq aquariums publics.

L'aquarium de la baie de Monterey a été reconnu comme le premier aquarium des États-Unis et il montre aux visiteurs la vie sous-marine de la baie. L'aquarium de Géorgie, qui a ouvert ses portes en 2005, se dit être le plus grand du monde. Il abrite plus de cent mille animaux marins dans trente millions de litres d'eau, dont deux requins-baleines, les plus gros poissons du monde.

Un autre aquarium a rouvert en 2005 à Camden, dans le New Jersey. L'Adventure Aquarium a ouvert ses portes pour la première fois en 1992. Il a dépensé environ cinquante millions de dollars pour agrandir son bâtiment et améliorer ses expositions.

Les aquariums offrent au public de nombreuses occasions de faire l'expérience de la vie sous-marine. On les trouve dans la plupart des régions du monde. Les gens pourraient même vouloir démarrer un aquarium à la maison et rejoindre les millions de personnes dans le monde qui élèvent des poissons comme animaux de compagnie.

"De nombreux experts affirment que Billy Wilder a changé l'histoire du cinéma américain. Il est souvent considéré comme le meilleur cinéaste que Hollywood ait jamais connu.

Il était connu pour réaliser des films offrant un commentaire social acerbe et des situations sexuelles pour adultes. Wilder fut l'un des premiers réalisateurs à le faire.

Entre le milieu des années 1930 et les années 1980, Billy Wilder a réalisé près de cinquante films. Durant cette période, il a reçu plus de vingt nominations de l'Académie des arts et des sciences du cinéma. Il a remporté six Oscars. Wilder a réalisé des films célèbres comme ""Boulevard du crépuscule"" et ""Assurance sur la mort"". Il a également réalisé ""Le Perdu"" et ""Sept ans de réflexion"".

Wilder est né en 1906 dans l'ancien empire austro-hongrois. Au début, il a commencé des études de droit à Vienne, en Autriche. Puis il a décidé d'abandonner cette voie. Dans les années 1920, il écrivait des scénarios en Allemagne. Cependant, les nazis avaient pris le pouvoir dans le pays. Wilder était juif et il a compris qu'il n'avait aucun avenir en Allemagne nazie. Il a alors quitté l'Europe pour l'Amérique.

Billy Wilder n'avait que onze dollars lorsqu'il est arrivé aux États-Unis en 1934. Il a formé une équipe d'écriture avec Charles Brackett. Les deux scénaristes ont créé de nombreux films ensemble.

Wilder et Brackett ont écrit plusieurs films à succès. Wilder a toujours salué cet homme comme un ami et un professeur dont l'humour et la direction experte ont grandement influencé son travail.

Dans ses histoires d'amour, Billy Wilder ne suivait pas la tradition hollywoodienne des situations sucrées de garçon rencontre fille. Il avait une façon particulière de montrer les relations entre les hommes et les femmes. Par exemple, l'un de ses films les plus réussis était ""Hold Back the Dawn"". En 1944, Billy Wilder a réalisé un film intitulé ""Assurance sur la mort"". Certains critiques ont déclaré que ce film l'avait établi comme l'un des plus grands réalisateurs hollywoodiens.

De fortes pluies ont également provoqué des glissements de terrain dans plusieurs comtés de la province du Sichuan. Les gens ont été contraints d'évacuer vers des lieux sûrs.
Glissements de terrain et dévastation
Les glissements de terrain se produisent lorsque la terre et les roches glissent ensemble sur une pente. Parfois, ces glissements de terrain sont petits et presque imperceptibles. Mais d'autres fois, ils peuvent être massifs, impliquant toute la face d'une montagne.
Les glissements de terrain peuvent être causés par un certain nombre de facteurs différents. Souvent, la pluie, qui ajoute du poids au flanc d'une pente, peut en provoquer un. D'autres fois, ils peuvent être causés par l'érosion. Lorsqu'un ruisseau érode lentement la base d'une pente, il affaiblit toute la face de la montagne.
Lorsqu'un glissement de terrain descend une pente de montagne, il peut prendre une grande vitesse et une grande énergie. Certains glissements de terrain se déplacent à une vitesse de 300 km/h. Les vents qui en résultent peuvent être si puissants qu'ils sont connus pour arracher les feuilles des arbres environnants.
Tremblements de terre et glissements de terrain
Certains experts pensent que les glissements de terrain du Sichuan sont liés au tremblement de terre de magnitude 8,0 de Wenchuan du 12 mai 2008. Le séisme a provoqué un changement dans la structure de la surface de la Terre, ce qui rend plus probable le glissement de terrain sous la pluie, selon le géologue Xu Qiang de l'Université de technologie de Chengdu.
Les glissements de terrain constituent une menace pour 140 villes et villages du pays, dont un quart se trouvent dans le Sichuan, a déclaré Wei Fangqiang, chercheur à l'Académie chinoise des sciences.
Prévention des glissements de terrain
Si vous voulez éviter d'être victime d'un glissement de terrain, la chose la plus simple à faire est d'éviter de vivre sur des pentes ou à proximité de montagnes.
Si vous vivez dans une zone menacée par les glissements de terrain, essayez de ne pas arroser les pentes si possible. S'il y a de gros rochers sur les pentes au-dessus de votre maison, enlevez-les afin qu'ils ne causent pas de dommages s'ils tombent. Il peut également être utile de planter des arbres sur les pentes. Au fil du temps, les racines des arbres peuvent rendre le sol plus ferme.

"The father's role in the family is important. One researcher says babies who are cared for by their fathers have greater cognitive   development at one year of age than babies not cared for by their fathers. Another researcher reports that by spending time with their pre-school children, fathers can help to develop children's language ability. Researchers also point out that for school-age children, fathers are one bridge with the outside world.
Fathers who value   education have children who do better in school than those children whose fathers don't value education. What's more, fathers who spend quality time with their children may give their children happy memories which may last a lifetime.
While each father is a _ person who educates children in his own style, good fathers have something in common.
Good fathers attend their children's school activities. They also involve the children in their lives and the adult world by taking them to see the workplace, or by taking them when the car needs to be repaired, etc.
Good fathers expect a great deal from their children, but also accept and support the unique individuals   that their children are becoming.
Good fathers prefer explanations and reasoning to force.
Good fathers know their time with children is really an investment   in them.
Being an involved father is good for children and good for fathers. Both children and fathers have the chance for growth and development. Today's lifestyles are changing. More and more fathers are keeping a balance between their personal life, work, and family time.","{

"December usually marks the start of humpback whale season in Hawaii. But experts say the animals have been slow to return.
The giant whales are an iconic part of winter on the islands and a source of income for tour operators. But officials at the Hawaiian Islands Humpback Whale National Marine Sanctuary said they've been getting reports that the whales have been difficult to spot so far.
""This isn't a concern. But it's of interest. One theory was that something like this happened as whales increased. It's a product of their success,"" said Ed Lyman. He is a Maui-based resource protection manager and response coordinator for the sanctuary.
""What I'm seeing out there right now is what I expected a month ago,"" said Lyman. He said he was surprised by how few of the animals he saw while responding to a call about a distressed calf on Christmas Eve. ""We've just seen a handful of whales.""
It will be a while before officials have hard numbers. That is because the annual whale counts don't take place until the last Saturday of January, February and March. This is according to former sanctuary co-manager Jeff Walters.
""They don't necessarily show up in the same place at the same time every year,"" Walters said.
More than 10,000 humpback whales make the winter journey from Alaska to the warm waters off Hawaii. There, they mate and give birth.
Lyman said the whales' absence could just mean they're spending more time feeding in northern waters. That's possibly because of El Nino disruptions. Or it may be because their population has gone up.
""With more animals, they're competing against each other for that food resource, and it takes huge energy reserves to make that long migration over 2,000 miles,"" he explained.","{

"Note-taking is a skill that can help you do well in all your schoolwork. It can make you confident when you are studying. But unluckily, most students don't know how to take notes.
Write down key facts. If your teacher writes notes on the blackboard, that's great. You can copy them or write down the most important facts of all in class. Different teachers do things differently. For example, some teachers may focus on   lots of dates and facts in class, but they only write the important ones on the blackboard. Other teachers may not write anything down, but they may say something important again and again.
Ask. Don't be afraid to ask your teacher to repeat what you miss. If your teacher speaks too fast and you can't follow what he is saying, you can ask him after class.
Compare. Comparing your notes with your classmates' can be good for your learning. It can also help you and your classmates correct some mistakes.
Organize . Note-taking also needs organization. Keep notes for each subject in one notebook, so that you can find everything easily when a test comes.
Good note-taking takes time. If you decide to recopy your notes every evening, you'll surely have less time to watch TV. But you'll save time in the coming test.","{

"Growers around the world are using new methods to grow grapes to make wine. They use natural and organic methods to control harmful insects and weeds instead of using chemicals. Now, a winery in Canada has adopted a natural way to control its grapevines  .The Featherstone Winery is in southern Ontario. The grapevines, like other plants, need to be cut every year.
Cutting grapevines must be done very carefully. Only a targeted area of leaves is removed from the lower part of the vines to help the grapes grow better. But at the Featherstone Winery, no man or machine does the cutting. Instead, the job is done by 40 little wooly lambs.www.zxxk.com
David Johnson owns the vineyard. He says he learned about using lambs while visiting wineries in New Zealand. The young lambs are perfectly designed to do the job. They eat the grape leaves on the lower parts of the vine. But they are not tall enough to reach the grapes. They only weigh about 22 kilograms, so they do not beat down the soil. And their waste makes good organic fertilizer. In addition, using the lambs costs much less than hiring workers to cut the vines for seven weeks in summer. And when the cutting is done in August, the lambs become tasty dishes.
Mr Johnson says he had a difficult time finding enough lambs to do the job. There are about 50 million lambs in New Zealand. But there are not nearly as many in Ontario. Also, some organic pesticides   are harmful to lambs. And the lambs must be watched to make sure they do not eat too much of the grapevines.
David Johnson says the lambs help him carry out his environmental ideas about farming. They are lovely and peaceful and he likes having them in his vineyard. People visiting the vineyard also enjoy watching the lambs do their job.","{

"WASHINGTON -- President Obama and his wife, Michelle, handed out Halloween treats to area children and military families at the White House Sunday evening.
Local students between 6 and 14 years old, along with children from military families, were invited to celebrate Halloween on the North Lawn.
The president and first lady, along with Mrs.Obama's mother, Marian Robinson, spent about 30 minutes passing out goodie bags.Obama wished each child a happy Halloween as he distributed the treats, pausing occasionally for hugs or to comment on costumes.
Later, the military families continued the celebration inside the White House.
The first couple joked to assembled reporters about children walking the long driveway in order to work off   the snacks.""This is the Let's Move method of trick-or-treating  ,"" Obama said, referring to Mrs.Obama's campaign to combat childhood obesity  .
The goodie bags contained a box of White House M&Ms, a cookie made by pastry chef   Bill Yosses, and dried fruit.
As they made their way across the lawn, the children meet a vast range of costumed characters ranging from a spooky Frankenstein (,<<>> ) to the Scarecrow from ""The Wizard of Oz."" Music from a jazz band dressed in pirate gear rang out across the White House grounds.
Multicolored pumpkins and gourds lined the driveway -- individually, in gravity-defying stacks and as part of a large mound over 5 feet tall.Pumpkin-headed scarecrows   made of cornstalks loomed over the path with menacingly raised arms.Under the White House portico, a mobile resembling bats flying through clouds fluttered around a lantern.
Some of the local trick-or-treaters were students at Bancroft Elementary, which helps tend the first lady's White House garden, and Tubman Elementary, which has a relationship with the White House chefs.
After trick-or-treating ended, the Obamas stood near the front door, welcoming the military families inside, helping children climb the short flight of steps and thanking parents for their service.","{

"I also went out every day,and I always had my gun with me. Sometimes I killed a wild animal,and then  _ 1 _ .
But when it got dark,I had to go to bed because I had no light. I couldn't read or write because I couldn't see. But in the end,I learnt how to use the fat of dead animals to make a light.
... And so my life went on. Every month I learnt to do or to make something new. But I had troubles and accidents too. Once there was a terrible storm with very heavy rain. The roof of my cave fell in,and nearly killed me!I had to build it up again with many pieces of wood.
 _ 2 _ . I cooked it over a fire or dried it in the sun. So I always had meat during the rainy months when I could not go out with a gun. I learnt to make pots to keep my food in. But I wanted very much to make a harder,stronger pot--a pot that would not break in a fire. I tried many times,but I could not do it. Then one day I was lucky. I made some new pots and put them in a very hot fire. They changed colour,but did not break. I left them there for many hours,and when they were cold again,I found that they were hard and strong. That night I was very happy. I had hot water for the first time on the island.
By then,I also had my own bread. That was luck,too. One day I found a little bag. We used it on the ship,to keep the chickens' food in. There was still some of the food in the bag,and I dropped some of it onto the ground. A month later I saw something bright green there,and after six months I had a very small field of corn. I was very excited. Perhaps now I could make my own bread!
It was easy to say,but not so easy to do. It is a lot of work to make bread from corn. Many people eat bread,but how many people can take corn from a field and make bread out of it without help?I had to learn and to make many new things.  _ 3 _ .
During all this time I never stopped thinking about escape. When I travelled across to the other side of the island,I could see the other islands,and I said to myself,'Perhaps I can get there with a boat. Perhaps I can get back to England one day. '
So I decided to make myself a boat. I cut down a big tree,and then began to make a long hole in it. It was hard work,but about six months later,I had a very fine canoe. Next,I had to get it down to the sea. How stupid I was!Why didn't I think before I began work?Of course,the canoe was too heavy. I couldn't move it!I pulled and pushed and tried everything,but it didn't move.  _ 4 _ .
That happened in my fourth year on the island. In my sixth year I did make myself a smaller canoe,but I did not try to escape in it. The boat was too small for a long journey,and I did not want to die at sea. The island was my home now,not my prison,and I was just happy to be alive. 
There were always things to do or to make. I learnt to make new clothes for myself from the skins of dead animals. They looked very strange,it is true,but they kept me dry in the rain...","{

"""Birds are not as loyal to their partners as you might think, with divorce, child abandonment and remarriage a common part of birds' life,"" a new book has shown. Author and biology professor Bridge Stutchbury, _ the love-bird belief that birds pair up for life. ""In terms of the top 10 beliefs about birds, the lasting pair bonds that we think about, do occur in some birds, but in most of the little songbirds that we studied, no,"" the professor from York University in Toronto said. The divorce rate among greater flamingos is 99 percent.
Stutchbury's book, The Private Lives of Birds, based on 20 years of research from radio filming and DNA testing shows male Acadian flycatchers fertilize  females far away from their home nests, "" The main discovery is that so many birds do divorce for what humans would describe as selfish reasons,"" Professor Stutchbury said. She noted that females may seek out males that are more colorful and better singers, or look to ""step up in the world"" and move to areas that are safer and have more food. ""Females are looking for the highest quality male so that their children will be of high quality,"" she added.
Professor Stutchbury said shorter summers may drive females to leave their nests before their young are fully grown up so they can quickly find new mates  and lay more eggs, leaving the males to feed the hungry chicks on their own.
Males can double their success in producing children by fertilizing neighboring females, but only ""mates"" care for the young, and some are none the wiser. ""  They can't tell when the egg comes out and whether it's theirs or not,"" She said. ""They have no way to know.""
Divorce is surprisingly common among birds, and most live with one partner for only a few months or years. Divorce rates range from 99 percent in the greater flamingo to zero in the wandering albatross .","{

"Music is an international language. The songs that are sung or played by instruments are beautiful to all people everywhere.
Popular music in America is what every student likes. Students carry small radios with earphones and listen to music before class, after class, and at lunch. Students with cars buy large speakers and play the music loudly as they drive on the street.
Adult drivers listen to music on the car radio as they drive to work. They also listen to the news about sports, the weather, politics ,and activities of the American people.
Pop or popular music singers make much money. They make a CD or tape which radio stations use in every state. Once the popular singer is heard throughout the country, young people buy his or her tapes. Some of the money from these tapes comes to the singer. Wherever the singer goes, ail the young people want to meet him or her. Now the singer has become a national star.
There are other kinds of music that are important to Americans. One is called folk music. It tells stories about the common life of Americans. Another is called western or country music. This was started by cowboys who would sing at night to the cows they were watching. Today, any music about country life and the love between a country boy and his girl is called western or country music.

"Zuhur Yasin has never been to the US, but she holds a bachelor's degree from an American university. Part of Yasin's studies in Somaliland were spent in a special classroom, lined with rows of computers equipped with webcams and microphones.
The 29-year-old watched videos and took part in live virtual  classes at Indiana University as part of her journalism programme at the University of Hargeisa.""We had discussions and shared any challenges or questions,"" she says.
The African Virtual University(AVU), an intergovernmental organization, connected Yasin with Indiana University. The AVU says it has used virtual learning to train 43, 000 students since its creation in 1997. Professors use programmes and apps including Skype and WhatsApp to communicate with students, but classes are taught using special software. The AVU is considering plans to make lectures accessible on mobile phones.
Like Yasin, many students in sub-Saharan Africa are looking for opportunities to attend university. In 2008, the region had the lowest university attendance in the world, with just 6% of secondary school-leavers advancing to higher education, according to the UN's Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization.
In May, the African Union(AU) opened the e-Learning Africa Conference on ICT for development, education and training at its headquarters in Addis Ababa.
Rebecca Stromeyer, the founder of e-Learning Africa, says, ""Now it is the time when technology can really help to protect the progress many African countries have made in education. If the right decisions are made now, they will help to achieve long-term economic growth.""
Experts say online learning tools can connect African students to massive open online courses (Mooc,) such as Coursera, an education platform that provides free virtual education from some of the world's top universities.","{

The Hanging Gardens of Babylon
The garden sat on a hill. It was a large and wonderful structure . Many parts of the garden were high up on large columns . There were many big and green trees with lovely flowers. Although there are many different ideas about the garden, we are not sure whether this wonder ever existed !

The Lighthouse of Alexandria was designed about 2,000 years ago. It was in Egypt, too. (B) It was one of the ancient wonders of the world, about 135 metres high. It was once the highest building in the world. Although it doesn't exist now, many people come to see its relic  every year.","{

"""Holding girls back from an education is robbing them of their dignity  ,"" says Mariam, a teacher, in an interview with Action Press.
""I feel proud when I tell people that I'm from Swat in Pakistan, with its green and mountainous valley. But I don't feel proud about the number of women and girls where I'm from who are still being unable to enjoy the right for an education.
""I have taught many students -- including Malaya, the young education activist who was shot in the head as travelling to school in Pakistan after campaigning for girls' education. Among them I see the dignity that education can offer. This is why I have long been devoted to teaching, and why I am doing what I can to make sure that all girls have the chance to go to school.
""At the Khushaal school and college in Mingora, many girls are prevented from going to school because of poverty and fights. However, the most common reasons for girls not attending classes are cultural. People fear that females will become too independent if educated. Instead, parents prefer to marry off girls early. Girls and young women are considered a financial burden if left dependent on their parents.""
""In the school where I have been teaching for over ten years, I have seen how this discrimination plays out. Parents regard an educated and independent female as being too clever for her own. Even if parents agree to give a girl an education, a limit is set to the number of years for her to attend classes and it is common for girls to make it through only primary school. This is why I have been working tirelessly to change these damaging views and cultural practices. These are crimes against humanity  ,which I have no choice but to strongly accuse of.""

"My favourite book is The Adventure of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain.Tom lives with his aunt Polly in a quiet street of St. Petersburg, Missouri.He's a lively and clever young boy,and he finds himself in many exciting adventures.He runs away with his two friends,Huck Finn and Joe,to an island in the middle of the Mississippi River for several days.With Huck he goes looking for treasure, with Becky he gets lost in a cave.and finally,they find a box of gold.
My favourite scene in the book is when everyone thinks Tom is dead.He decides to go to his own funeral.He hides and watches for a time and then suddenly he appears. Everyone is astonished to see him but they're also pleased to see him alive.
Tom is the hero of the story,but there are other important characters.Huck is an outsider and everyone is afraid of him.Becky is pretty with fair hair,Joe is Tom's best friend.and Injun Joe is the bad man of the story.
The theme of the  story  is about children growing up.It describes how strangers are seen in small towns of America. Finally, it talks about freedom,social rules and how people are  punished for bad behaviour.
Why do I think The Adventure of Tom Sawyer is a great book? Mark Twain wrote the story in 1876,but it's still read and loved by people all over the world today. And although it's only a story, Twain wrote it in the everyday English of the southern states of America in  the 19th century,so it sounds very real. Today it's thought to be one of the greatest books in American literature. Go on--- read it! I know you'll enjoy it,too.","{

"Does stress cause gray hair? Many people believe that tension and stress can cause your hair to lose its color.In fact,it is an old wives tale that being upset all the time can result in premature graying.Here is a closer look at this situation and why some believe that this old wives tale could be true.
As one ages,the hairs on the head also age.In fact,just about everything on the human body begins to show signs of wear and tear after a while.The joints wear and become stiff and skin wears and becomes wrinkled.Hairs on the head grow and eventually die.They are replaced,but in the process something else happens.
When new hairs are replaced,the color or pigment is also added to them.However,as one ages,this pigment becomes less and less available.At first,hairs will have a limited amount of pigment and they will appear to be grayish in color.In time,they will lose all of their pigment and will be white.Many things are known to cause graying.and genetics is a very powerful factor.If one of your parents turns gray at an early age,there is a good chance that you will too.Some people begin the graying process in high school,while others may be over the age of forty.
Constant worry and tension can have many harmful effects on the human body.It is a known fact that stressful times can cause one to suffer hair loss.It would make sense that if it can cause these problems,perhaps it also may contribute to graying.However,there is no sound evidence to support this.
On the other hand,many medical professionals believe that there may be a link:between graying and a constant state of anxiety or tension.Does stress cause gray hair? There is no scientific evidence to support the theory,but it is best to avoid stressful situations.","{

"People all over the world like eating delicious food. If there is no salt in the food, it may not be very tasty. So there is often a lot of salt in food because people like the taste of salty food. However, too much salt is not food for you. If you cook food by yourself, you can control  the amount  of salt to keep your family healthy.
However, many processed  foods already have salt in them Fast foods often have a lot of salt in them. Canned foods often have salt. Packed foods such as biscuits have salt. Packed foods like potato chips have a lot of salt in them.
It is reported that the income of too much salt can lead to high blood pressure  and other kinds of diseases. So don't put too much salt into your dishes. How much salt should a person eat a day? Look at the following:
1--3 years   2g
4--6 years   3g
7--10 years  4g
11 and over  5g
You don't need any more salt than this. If your mom or dad is cooking, you had better ask them not to add too much salt. You will find that the food still tastes really good. It can also help your mom or dad to cut down to a healthier level of salt.","{

"A mouse happened to look through a hole in the wall to see the farmer and his wife open a package. ""What food might this contain?"" The mouse wondered. But he was sad to discover it was a mousetrap  .
Back to the farmyard, the mouse announced this warning: ""There is a mousetrap in the house! There is a mousetrap in the house!""
The hen clucked   and scratched, raised her head and said, ""Mr. Mouse, I can tell this is a great concern to you, but it is of no consequence to me. I cannot be bothered by it.""
Then the mouse turned to the pig. The pig sympathized, but said, ""I am very sorry, Mr. Mouse, but there is nothing I can do about it but pray. Be assured you are in my prayers.""
Then the mouse turned to the cow and repeated the same words. The cow said, ""Moo, Mr. Mouse. I'm sorry for you, but it's no skin off my nose.""
So, the mouse returned to the house, head down and sadly faced the farmer's mousetrap alone. That very night a sound was heard throughout the house - the sound of a mousetrap catching its prey  . The farmer's wife rushed to see what was caught. In the darkness, she did not see it. It was a poisonous snake whose tail was caught in the trap. The snake bit the farmer's wife. The farmer rushed her to the hospital. When she returned home, she still had a fever.
Everyone knows fresh chicken soup is good to treat a fever. So the farmer took his knife to the farmyard. The hen was killed.
But his wife's sickness continued. Friends and neighbors came to sit with her around the clock. To feed them, the farmer butchered the pig.
The farmer's wife did not get well but died. So many people came for her funeral that the farmer had the cow killed to provide enough meat for all of them for the lunch.

"Success is everybody's dream. But what is the key to success? How can you be successful? I think we should measure success based on how much we give rather than how much we receive. Fortunately, it also works nicely the other way around since those who give more almost always will also receive more. So how do you pave your way to success? How do you become more successful? The answer is amazingly simple: the key to success is making yourself as useful as possible to others. Here are some ideas on how to do it.
1. Be observant of needs
To be useful to others, you should always be aware of even the slightest clues of needs. The more sensitive you are to the needs of others, the more appreciative people will eventually become. The best plan is being able to
a need before the other people are even aware of it.
2. Find solutions to the needs
Now that you are aware of needs, the next step is finding solutions to them. The solutions you offer should be as useful as possible. To be able to do so, there is no other way but to continuously build your own value. It is from the value you have that you could give value to others.
3. Be proactive to help
Do not wait for the other person to ask for your help. Be proactive. Give your help even before they ask.
4.   _  
What matters is not only the solution you offer, but also the way you deliver it. Being sincere means being glad to help others without expecting anything in return. Make it your joy to give something to others. People can somehow distinguish whether or not you are sincere.
5. Go the extra mile
Doing the above four steps is good, but add this one if you can: give more than expected. First, give what is expected, and then add a little more. If you do the above four steps people will be appreciative, but if you add this one step they will be impressed.","{

"In New York City public schools, 176 different languages are spoken among the more than 1 million students. For 160,000 children, English is not their first language. New York's Department of Education makes learning better for these students by providing dual-language programs, in which students are taught in two languages, English and another one, like Russian or Chinese. Math, social studies, science and all other regular courses are taught in both languages. And they learn about the culture of the other country.
Milady Baez, Deputy Chancellor of English Language Learners and Student Support, says these dual-language programs will help children succeed in the future. ""The jobs of the future require that our students know more than one language. They are going to be traveling abroad; they are going to be communicating with people from all over the world. This will open doors for them.""
Middle-schoolers might not have jobs on their minds yet. For Kequing Jaing, she likes keeping up her first language, Mandarin.""It makes me feel that I am home because I can speak in Chinese, learn in Chinese, while learning in English. So it makes me feel better and makes me understand more about the task I'm learning.""[:ZSSxxSSk.Com]

She says the Russian-English program keeps her connected to her heritage and her parents happy.""They're really happy about the program. They are really happy that I can preserve my culture and my language, and that I can speak it fluently in school.""
The New York schools also offer dual-language programs in seven other languages: Arabic, French, Haitian Creole, Hebrew, Korean, Polish and Spanish. There are plans to add even more languages in the future.
While these dual-language programs are popular, some organizations in the U.S. say teaching English comes first. U.S. Studies show that children who learn English early will be more successful later.","{

"The question of what children learn, and how they should learn, is continually being debated and redebated. Nobody dares any longer to defend the old system, the learning of lessons parrot-fashion, the grammar-with-a-whip system, which was good enough for our grandparents. The theories of modem psychology have stepped in to argue that we must understand the need of children. Children are not just small adults; they are children who must be respected as much.
Well, you may say, this is as it should be, a good idea. But think further. What happens? ""Education"" becomes the responsibility not of teachers, but of psychologists  . What happens then? Teachers worry too much about the psychological implications   of their lessons, and forget about the subjects themselves. If a child dislikes a lesson, the teacher feels that it is his fault, not the child's. So teachers worry whether history is ""relevant"" to modern young children. And do they dare to recount stories about violence? Or will this make the children themselves violent? Can they tell their classes about children of different races, or will this encourage racial hatred? Why teach children to write grammatical sentences? Verbal expression is better. Sums? Arithmetic? No: Real-life mathematical situations are more understandable.
You see, you can go too far. Influenced by educational theorists, who have nothing better to do than to write books about their ideas, teachers leave their teacher-training colleges filled with grand, psychological ideas about children and their needs. They make elaborate, sophisticated (,) preparations and try out their ""modem methods"" on the long-suffering children. Since one ""modem method"" rapidly replaces another the poor kids will have had a good bellyful by the time they leave school. Frequently the modem methods are so sophisticated that they fail to be understood by the teachers, let alone the children; even more often, the relaxed discipline so essential for the "" informal"" feelings the class must have, prevents all but a handful of children from learning anything.","{

"About 6,000doctors in theprefix = st1 /Philippinesare studying to become nurses so they can find higher-paying jobs abroad, Health Secretary Francisco Duque says.
  This was up from 2,000 doctors who studied to become nurses last year, Duque said.
  The exodus of doctors and nurses had created a ""threatening situation for our health care system"" and a task force had been established to examine the potential impact, he said.
  The team was working on a bill which would require doctors to practice in thePhilippinesfor at least three to four years before they were able to work abroad.
  ""I think the problem really is the migration of doctors. We have so many nurses now, more than enough to fill up(vacancies). But our doctors are leaving,"" Duque said.

"It's Really a Miracle  
Mr. Brown works in New York and he brought his family to China last summer. They visited many places of interest and had a good time here. Before they left for New York, the Browns climbed the Great Wall. It was the greatest project over two thousand years ago. They took a lot of photos there and then they had a picnic under a big tree. Suddenly it began to rain and they hurried to the car. And when they returned to the hotel, they couldn't find the bag in which their expensive camera was. They were all sorry for it. They could buy another camera but had no time to go to the Great Wall again. They could not miss the plane!
That evening they didn't have supper. Mr. Brown hoped to make them happy, so he said, ""Well, let me tell you a story. An old man lived in a sixty-floor building. One day he fell down from it when he was cleaning the window. But he didn't hurt himself.""

"London's Chinese community  dates back to the 18thcentury, when a small number of Chinese sailors moved to the city to work in Limhouse, east London. As time went on, other Chinese people came to this area and Limhouse began to be known as ""Chinatown"". However London's Chinese community remained very small for many years: at the start of the 20thcentury, there were just 545 Chinese people in Britain.
After the Second World War, many farmers in Hong Kong lost their jobs and came to London. As Limhouse had been almost destroyed during the war, they settled  in different area--a part of central London near Leicester Square. This area is now what Londoners call Chinatown.
At first, the new immigrants   found it difficult to get jobs. In the 1950s, however, a small Chinese restaurant opened in London. Many British people visited it and said that Chinese food was wonderful! Suddenly, Chinese restaurants and take-aways started opening in every part of the city. Instead of too little work, the new Chinese immigrants now found that they had too much! They worked as cooks, managers or waiters. Most of them enjoyed their lives and arranged their friends and relatives to join them from overseas.
As time went by, London's Chinese community became more and more successful. The sons and daughters of the original restaurant workers studied and worked very hard.

"A person has been badly injured in a car accident. It is necessary to give him a transfusion   because he has lost much blood in the accident. However, special care must be taken in selecting new blood for him. If the blood is too different from his own, the transfusion can kill him.
There are four basic blood groups: A, B, AB and O. A single test can tell us a person's blood group. Everybody is born with one of these four blood groups. People's blood group, like hair colour, is inherited   from parents.
Because the substances contained in each group are different, transfusion must be given carefully. Basically, A and B cannot be mixed. A and B cannot receive AB, but AB may receive A or B. O can be given to any other group, so it is often called the universal donor. On the contrary, AB is sometimes called the universal recipient  . However, before being given the transfusion, patients usually receive only salt or plasma   until their blood can be matched as exactly as possible. In this way, it is possible to avoid any bad results of the transfusion.
There is a relationship between our blood groups and our nationalities. Among the Europeans, about 42 percent are blood group A while 45 percent are blood group O. The rarest is blood group AB. However, some American Indian groups are nearly 100 percent blood group O.","{

"A new satellite is travelling 1.5 million kilometers over a 110-day period to enter an orbit of the sun. It is called DSCOVR--the Deep Space Climate Observatory. It will replace a satellite that has been observing space weather.
DSCOVR will begin its work during the worst of the 11-year-long solar cycle. This is a time when extreme weather on the sun can have the greatest effect on planet Earth.
DSCOVR will gather information about a continuing flow of particles from the sun. We are protected from these particles by the Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere. But we are not fully protected from what scientists call Coronal Mass Ejections. These are strong storms that can happen on the sun's surface.
Thomas Berger is the director of the Space Weather Prediction Center at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA. He says these ejections are much more dangerous than solar particles. He says the Coronal Mass Ejections are extremely large magnetic clouds that are expelled from the sun at extremely high speeds. He says when they impact Earth, it is like a hurricane impacting Earth in terms of space weather.
Violent space weather can make electric systems stop working. It can block satellite signals to Earth. It can interfere with radio signals and air travel.
Mr. Berger says we cannot stop the ejections from affecting us, but we can prepare for them if we know when they will happen. When the DSCOVR satellite records an ejection, it will release a warning. Mr. Berger says the warning will provide NOAA about 15 to 60 minutes to let people know that a very strong storm is coming in to the Earth. He says that is enough time for power grid operators to take protective action. He says it is also enough time for workers to place satellites on a safe operating method if necessary.
Mr. Berger says scientists would like even more time, of course. He says researchers are developing instruments that will give an earlier warning.
The warnings from DSCOVR will be for the whole planet. But Mr. Berger says a new system may be able to give more-targeted warnings. He says future models will be able to tell exactly what part of the world will be more at risk from a solar storm.
That means that, for the first time, humans will get both a warning that a magnetic storm is heading towards Earth and information about where it is likely to hit.","{

"An annoying problem for humans, who like to boast   about all the distant planets and moons we have explored, is that we've never taken a good look right under our noses. The inside of the earth is relatively close, but how can we get there?
The deepest oil well enters a mere six miles into the crust   (the center of the earth is about 4,000 miles deeper). Russian scientists dug the deepest hole in Siberia, but bottomed out at about 7.5 miles below the surface. The Mohole project, a U.S. plan in the 1950s, called for drilling a hole 25 miles down to the boundary between the hard rocks of the crust and the soft mantle  . Sadly the project involved government supporting.
It gets harder and harder to drill deep into the earth because rocks get softer and softer. Hard but easily broken at the surface, rocks become plastic at depth, and the pressure caused by the weight of the overlaying crust ---  about 52,800 pounds per square inch at a depth of ten miles, makes further drilling impossible.
What little we know about the inside of the earth (like the fact that there's a crust, a mantle, and a core) comes from indirect evidence, such as the analysis of earthquakes.
So maybe it's time for a thorough new method to explore the earth's inside. Scientist David Stevenson says we should forget about drilling holes. Instead, we should open a crack  .
Stevenson suggests digging a crack about a half mile long, a yard wide, and a half mile deep (not with a shovel) but with an explosion on the scale of a nuclear bomb. Next, he'd pour a few hundred thousand tons of molten   iron into the crack, along with a robot. The iron, thicker than the surrounding crust, would move downward at about 16 feet per second, carrying the robot with it and opening the crack deeper and deeper. The iron mass would drop for about a week and 2,000 miles to the outer edge of the earth core, the robot sending out data to the surface.
Stevenson compares his idea to space exploration. ""We're going somewhere we haven't been before,""he says. ""In all possibility, there will be surprises.""
This idea can probably be put in the drawer marked with Isn't Going To Happen. The robot would have to survive temperatures that would melt pretty much anything. But Stevenson's idea may inspire a new look at an old problem. Great things can come from what seems like impossible ideas.","{

"Man is the most intelligent animal created by God because God has given him language which other animals do not have. Communication makes life extremely convenient and easy. Language plays a very important role in life as any emotion can be easily and effectively conveyed   through language to anyone. But all this is applicable and beneficial only to human beings. What about animals? How do they communicate with each other?
We all know that animals do not have the ability to use language as a medium for communication. But they do have other means of conveying messages to other animals, of which use of body language is the most important one. The messages can be of many types like conveying food location, danger alarms, appreciation of good deeds like helping other animals in dangerous situations, etc. There are two main types of communication in animals: verbal   communication and non-verbal communication.
Sound is one of the most common types of verbal communication in animals, and majority of the species use it as the medium to convey messages. Bats have to rely on sound waves to communicate. They mostly rest in the morning and become active at night to search for food and do other tasks. All the birds communicate through their chirping. Mammals generally make use of sounds to give calls to other members of their community. Whales are the perfect examples, which use sound waves for communication. They have a whale song, which they repeat after regular intervals.
Facial Expressions
This kind of communication is mostly found in dogs. When they are angry, they show their teeth and raise their ears. On the other hand, when they are frightened, they pull their ears behind and open their mouth. Also, in birds, when the parent bird brings food for the offspring, the begging expression can be observed on the offspring's face.
Gestures and Body Movements
This type of communication is common not only in animals, but in human beings too. All human beings, although they use language for communication, tend to use gestures and body movements as well while communicating. Honey bees are the most enthusiastic creatures on earth because they dance to communicate. Some bees dance in the hive   so that other bees get signals of the location of the honey comb. A deer waves its tail to warn others of coming danger.","{

"Millions of young people are writing blogs . Millions of others are reading them. The word ""blog"" is a short way of saying Web log.
Many popular Web sites now offer free, easy ways to create personal Web pages and fill them with writings and pictures. Web sites called ""Face book"" and ""My Space"" are some of the most popular blog sites for young people. 
Blogs offer young people a place to show their writings and feelings. They can also be helpful to connect young people with others. But blogs can become dangerous when they are read on the Internet by millions of people all over the world.
Recent studies show that young people often tell their names, age and where they live on the Internet. That may not be safe for them. This personal information puts them in danger when found out by dangerous people who want to hurt them. Students can also get into trouble when they put information about others on their blogs. 
   As a result, many schools don't allow using blogging web sites on school computers. Many schools have also begun teaching parents about the web sites. Parents should know what their children are doing online and should read their blogs to make sure they are not giving out personal information.

"There have always been a lot of commonly believed but false  ideas about being fat and doing exercise. Some people believe that they can't help putting an weight as they get older, while others hold that if they stop exercising, their muscles  will turn into fat. Here are some more myths.
I'll never lose weight--I come from a fat family
Wrong! While we can't change the body type we are born with, we can't blame our genes  for making us fat. There's plenty of evidence that fatness runs in families, and the main reason is that they share the same habit of eating too much and exercise too little.
I am fat because I burn calories slowly
Wrong! Fatness is not caused by a slow metabolism . In fact, although fat people consume   more energy than slim people, they also fail to realize how much they eat. Keeping a diary can help you work out your daily food intake more accurately .
Exercise is boring
Wrong! Anything will become boring if you do it again and again. The key is to develop a balanced and varied  program that's fun as well as progressive . If you enjoy a Sunday walk, take a different mute. If you do yoga , try a tai chi class.
No pain, no gain
Wrong! Exercise is not meant to hurt. Indeed, pain is your body telling you something's wrong, and continuing to exercise could lead to serious injury . You may experience mild discomfort as you begin to exercise regularly, but this is your body _ the positive changes in your lifestyle and the aches should disappear quickly. If they don't, rest and ask for medical advice.","{

"Traditional fairytales are being abandoned by parents because they are too horrible for their young children, a study found.
Research revealed one in five parents dislike old classics such as Snow White and the Seven Dwarves and Rapunzel and are in favor of more modern books. One third of parents said their children have been left in tears after hearing the horrible details of Little Red Riding Hood. And nearly half of mothers and fathers refuse to read Rumplestiltskin to their kids as the themes of the story are about kidnapping and crimes. Similarly, Goldilocks and the Three Bears was also a tale likely to be left on the book shelf as parents felt it forgives stealing.
The survey of 2,000 adults was conducted to mark the launch of the hit US drama GRIMM, which starts tonight at 9pm on Watch, and sees six episodes based on traditional fairytales. The survey found a quarter of parents questioned wouldn't consider reading a fairytale to their child until they had reached the age of five, as they prompt too many awkward questions from their children.
Steve Hornsey, General Manager of Watch, said: ""Bedtime stories are supposed to calm down children and send them off to sleep soundly. But as we see in GRIMM, fairytales can be dark and dramatic tales so it's understandable that parents worry about reading them to young children.""
""As adults we can see the innocence in fairytales, but a five-year-old child with an over active imagination could take things too seriously. Despite the dark nature of classic fairytales, as we see in GRIMM, good will triumph over evil and there is always a moral to the story.""
The study also found two thirds of mums and dads try to avoid stories which might give their children nightmares.
However, half of parents said traditional tales are more likely to have a strong moral message than a lot of modern kids' books, such as The Gruffalo, The Hungary Caterpillar and the Mr. Men books.","{

"Have you ever heard the saying "" _ ""?
Here is how a new teacher made friends with the girls and boys in her class on the first day of school. As the bell rang, the teacher smiled at each girl and boy. Then she said in a quiet voice, ""Good morning. How nice it is to have all of you in my class this year. I'd like to know each of you. I am sure we will enjoy working together."" Everyone felt that she meant what she said because of her sweet voice and her friendly look.
She told the girls and boys her name and wrote it on the blackboard. Then she told them some of the things she liked to do and she was hoping to do with them during the year.
Then she said to the class, ""Now you know my name and the things I like and I want to know your names and the things you like. Then I will feel that I know you.""
Could you make friends by doing the same as this teacher did?
One way of getting to know girls and boys in your class is to find out more about them. It is often easy to be friends with those people who have the same hobbies with you. You play the same games and go on journeys together.
You may find that some new comers in your class miss their old friends and feel strange and lonely. You can invite them to take a walk or to ride bikes with you. You will find many things in common to talk about. Just talking together in a friendly manner is one good way to make friends.","{

"""If I rest, I _ ""----would be an excellent motto for those who are troubled by the slightest bit of idleness.Even the most hard-working person might adopt it with advantage to serve as a reminder that, if one allows his abilities to rest, like the iron in the unused key, they will soon show signs of rust and, eventually, cannot do the work required of them.
Those who would attain the heights reached and kept by great men must- keep their ability polished by constant use, so that they may unlock the doors of knowledge, the gate that guard the entrances to the professions, to science, art, literature, agriculture--every department of human endeavor.
Industry keeps the key bright that opens the treasury of achievement.If Hugh Miller, after toiling all day in a quarry, had devoted his evenings to rest and recreation, he would never have become a famous geologist.The celebrated mathematician, Edmund Stone, would never have published a mathematical dictionary, never have found the key to science of mathematics, if he had given his spare moments to idleness, had the little Scotch lad, Ferguson, allowed the busy brain to go to sleep while he tended sheep on the hillside instead of calculating the position of the stars by a string of beads, he would never have become a famous astronomer.

"Emily and Zach are confused!  Their parents told them they could choose between Massachusetts and Arizona for their vacation this summer.
Emily has always wanted to visit Boston, the capital of Massachusetts. Zach and she both agree that walking along the Freedom Trail would enable them to see Boston's most famous places of historic interest, like the site of the school Ben Franklin attended and the Old State House. If Emily and Zach go to Massachusetts, they could spend a few days at the beaches on Cape Cod. Emily loves body boarding, and Zach is great at body surfing. They both enjoy building sandcastles with their mom and dad.
Zach finds learning about Native Americans wonderful and has always wanted to travel along the Apache Trail in Arizona. This mountain highway passes Native American ruins in Tonto National Forest. Emily is not as interested in traveling along this trail as Zach, but they both would like to visit Phoenix, the capital, and then travel to Grand Canyon National Park and Meteor Crater .Zach learned in science class that Meteor Crater is a hole over 4,000 feet wide and 520 feet deep that was created when a huge object from space fell to Earth. The object went so deep that it has never been found. Zach would really like to try to discover it. But Emily thinks if experienced scientists and researchers cannot find it, Zach might as well not even bother to try.
The only drawback for Zach and Emily if they choose Arizona would be the heat. It is very hot and dry in this southwestern state. Massachusetts, on the other hand, is in northeastern United States. Here Zach and Emily and their parents could enjoy mild temperatures. Their parents love hot weather, but Zach and Emily do not really like to sweat.

"China Youth says that more and more girl students have entered colleges to study in recent few years. As we know, once the number of boys was larger than that of girls, and the boys did much better than girls in our country for a long time. Now things have changed a lot.
In recent years, the proportion of girl students is growing fast. In 1998, about 39.7% of college students were girls. In 2000, it was 41.07% and in 2001, the number was 42.14%.
There are several reasons for this.
Firstly, there is little difference between boys and girls in their intelligence . That's to say, girls are as clever as boys. And boys have more interests than girls, so they may not do well in their study.
Secondly, girls are more careful and more sensible than boys. They work harder at school and they do better in all exams.
Another reason is that with the development of society, people pay more and more attention to girls' education.","{

"ESP, Extra Sensory Perception, is a catch-all expression for the so-called ability of certain people to receive transmitted thoughts from others, to transmit their own thoughts, to see what will happen in the future or to be able to move objects from one place to another without physically touching them. These special people are called psychics. Some believe that we all have this ability to some degree but that most of us choose not to develop it.
              Many people are skeptical about ESP. Alongside the existence of documented evidence, there are plenty of claims that have turned out to be cheating. For most people, it is difficult to accept such claims without having had first hand experience. The lack of scientific evidence is another factor to take into account. On the other hand, most of us have, at some time, experienced a seemingly unexplainable occurrence; hearing the telephone ring and knowing who will be on the other end of the line or cases of coincidence that seem to be too extreme to be accidental.
              Over the years there have been numerous ESP experiments conducted by serious scientists in serious institutions. Joseph Banks Rhine, a botanist at Duke University published a famous book in 1934 called ""Extra-Sensory Perception"" in which he claimed to have enormous evidence of ESP. However, other scientists have been unable to copy his results since, which has resulted in the book losing much of its original credibility and fame.
              The Ganzfield Experiments are considered to have been the most carefully examined ESP experiments. So-called psychics had their eyes covered and ears blocked while a ""sender"" attempted to transmit messages. Later the psychics would compare the messages received to the original messages sent out. There was a great deal of excitement and interest at the time, but the research failed to produce convincing results.
              One of the strongest criticisms against ESP is that in order for it to exist, the fundamental laws of physics would necessarily have to be broken.
              Human beings are attracted to the whole range of supernatural phenomena. ESP will always continue to fascinate. This becomes clear when we see how much of the media is dedicated to the topic: magazines, journals, web sites, television and radio programs. Some of the most successful films in recent years have fuelled interest among the younger generations who are starting to ask the same questions and to look for explanations for the same phenomena as their parents and grandparents before them. Who knows? One day we might just find these answers because one thing is certain: ""The truth is out there! ""","{

"Do you know anything about the history of weather? Don't look at the sky. Don't look for old weather reports. Looking at the tree rings is more important. Correct weather reports date back only one century, but some trees can provide an exact record of weather even further back.
It is natural that a tree would grow best in a climate with plenty of sunlight and rainfall. It is also expected that little sunlight or rainfall would reduce the growth of a tree. The change from a favorable to an unfavorable climate can be found out by the reading pattern of rings in a tree trunk. To find out the weather of ten years ago, you can count the rings of a tree trunk from the outside to the inside. If the tenth ring is far from the other rings, then it is certain that plenty of sunny and rainy weather occurred. If the rings are close together, then the climate was bad for the tree.
  Studying trees is important not only for the history of weather, but also for the history of man. In an area of New Mexico you can find only sand -- no trees or people. However, many centuries ago a large population lived there. They left suddenly. Why?
  A scientist studied the pattern of the rings of dead trees that had grown there. He made up his mind that the people had to leave because they had cut down all the trees. Trees were necessary to make fires and buildings. So, after the people destroyed the trees, they had to move.
  In this example studying tree rings uncovered an exciting fact about the history of man.","{

"The lights dimmed,the musical hall grew quiet and out walked the conductor   shiny and white and 4 feet and 3 inches tall.
ASIMO, a robot designed by Honda Motor Co., met its latest challenge Tuesday evening: Conducting the Detroit Symphony  , in a performance of ""The Impossible  Dream"" from ""Man of La Mancha"".
""Hello, everyone,"" ASIMO said to the audience in a childlike voice, then waved to the orchestra. As it conducted, it perfectly mimicked   the actions of a conductor,
nodding its head at various sections and gesturing with one or both hands. ASIMO took a final bow to excited shouts from the audience. Later, cellist Yo-Yo Ma joined ASIMO onstage to receive an award for his efforts in music education.
Honda spokeswoman Alicia Jones says it is the first time ASIMO has conducted an orchestra, and it may be the first time any robot has conducted a live performance. But ASIMO has its  limits. ASIMO's engineers programmed the robot to mimic Charles Burke, the Detroit Symphony's education director, as he conducted the piece in front of a pianist about six months ago. But it can't respond to the musicians.
""It's not a communicative device. It simply is programmed to do a set of gestures,"" said Leonard Slatkin, the orchestra's musical director. ""If the orchestra decides to go faster, there's nothing the robot can do about it. Hopefully, I keep that under control.""

"Raising Money to Find a Cure, One Ribbon Barrette at a Time
How many times a day do we tell our kids that we're proud of them? Probably not nearly enough. As a daughter of Chinese parents, it's not in our culture's nature to celebrate incredible accomplishments by announcing them to the world, but I'm going to break the rule and announce that I'm so proud of my 10-year-old daughter and all that she has done to raise money to support research to find a cure for Cystic Fibrosis(CF,)
""Mommy, "" said Emily as we rushed around the house packing our things for another day at the pool last summer. ""I'm going to bring my ribbon barrettes to sell during adult swimming""
Emily's best friend is one of the 30,000 children and adults living in the United States with Cystic Fibrosis, a life-threatening genetic disease that affects the lungs and digestive system. In the 1950s, very few children with CF lived to attend elementary school. Although great progress in understanding and treating CF has led to great improvements in the length and quality of life for those with CF, there still isn't a cure.
Last spring, Emily donated $ 140 CFF's Great Walk in honor of her best friend living with Cystic Fibrosis. She had no idea what the summer would bring for her CFF ribbon barrette fundraise when school ended for the year. Fortunately, every time I shared a photo of Emily's ribbon barrettes on the Internet, we received orders that privately message me or email me with requests for barrettes in their favorites colors.
Three weeks into the summer, Emily had raised $ 297 and I was spending a lot of time running her to the craft store to restock her supplies for a very good cause while my husband was packing and shipping orders all over the country. My social media accounts have served as the most powerful tool for Emily to spread the _ . People notice kids doing great things and want to help the girls who are raising money to help find a cure, one ribbon barrette at a time.
Emily and her best friend have named their activity Ribbon Barrettes for Research. They have business cards and a brand new shiny website developed on a free platform, to show that any kid can do what she has been doing.
To my daughter, each sale is a victory and each order that goes out is an opportunity to spread awareness about CF. The handwritten thank-you note included in each order further shows the importance of teaching kids and parents how much their purchase support research that we hope will one day find a cure for CF.
As a parent, I love that Emily has found the power in her own voice and she has inspired others to advocate causes they care about.","{

"The rapid growth of Smartphones and electronic tablets is making the Internet favourite for Americans reading news, a report said.
News consumption online increased 17% last year from the year before. Television news, newspapers, radio and magazines all lost audience last year. For the first time, the number of people who get news online at least three times a week is larger than the number of people who get news from the newspapers. TV news has been the most popular since the 1960s. It has replaced the afternoon newspapers. But now the online news seems to be more popular than the TV news.
People are used to having the Internet available on phones or small tablets. In December, 2010, 41% of Americans said they got most of their news on the Internet, more than double the 17% who said that a year earlier, the report said. In January, 2011, 7% of Americans owned electronic tablets, nearly double what it was three months earlier. It was the fastest-growing new digital technology, ahead of mobile phones when they were introduced. The online ad income was expected to surpass print newspaper ad income for the first time in 2010.
The news business used to be the intermediary . You needed newspapers and TV stations to reach your customers. In this age of the computer, it's the software developers that you need.","{

"Beijing ---- A recent Chinese blockbuster   ""A World Without Thieves"" is based on the experiences of a young migrant worker  carrying 60,000 yuan on a train packed with thieves.But while the image of a warm-hearted but somewhat naive migrant worker may have made film fans chuckle, it's a sure bet that most of China's migrant workers are yet to step into a cinema to admire it.
         ""Forty yuan a ticket? I can't afford it,"" said Shen Jie, a migrant worker at a construction site in Dongzhimen, east Beijing.
         Shen found it hard to remember when he last watched a film, or what it was about.""It must be 10 years ago,"" he said.
         Though they are the builders of the nation's theaters and cinemas, a limited cultural life is common among China's 120 million migrant workers.
         Shen arrived from East China's Zhejiang Province in1991.Life was better then; money seemed to come more easily.""Now, as more and more workers are rushing to the capital, it's too hard to earn money, and none of us dare think about watching films,"" he said.
         For many like Shen, the dream is earning enough to pay for their children's education so they can find jobs in the cities and say goodbye to the hardships of rural life forever.This drives them to work hard and save as much as possible.
         With a monthly salary of less than 500 yuan, Shen has to send money home to his little son and silver-haired parents.
         In Shen's small dormitory, which he shares with seven other co-workers, there is a well-thumbed copy of a magazine published in 1998.
         A recent survey by local media revealed that 80 percent of migrant workers spent their spare time sleeping and chatting because of exhaust and a lack of income.The same survey found that 47 percent of migrant workers have to work for more than 10 hours a day.Around 40 percent do not even possess a book, and nearly 60 percent say they are dissatisfied with their cultural life.
         Like many of Shen's co-workers, reading newspapers and hanging out in Beijing's streets provide evening entertainment.
                                                              From   China Daily","{

"""Migrant workers""  is a familiar term for 17-year-old Shi Jian. Her father and uncle often talk about the problems surrounding this group of people. However, Shi cares more about the children of these migrant workers.
Last year Shi's housekeeper's daughter had to give up her schooling in Beijing because she would not be allowed to sit the national college entrance exam. She was forced to continue her high school education in her hometown in Sichuan Province.
Shi thinks the current law is unfair for migrant workers' children, as it prevents them from studying at public schools, unless their parents pay huge sums. So, Shi decided to do a survey of migrant workers so that she could find some solutions to help solve the problem.
In the last six months Shi spoke to 186 migrant workers in Beijing. Her interviewees include babysitters, guards, keepers, supermarket clerks, house cleaners and construction site workers. Shi found out that 55 of them were parents. Among this group, only eight have children who attend schools in Beijing. The other 47 had to leave children with relatives in the countryside. However, 40 of the 47 would like to enroll  their children in city schools.
From her interviews, Shi found that the workers' lowest income was 400 yuan each month. Over one-third earn a monthly wage of or below 1000 yuan. ""Even schools for migrant workers' children charge more than public schools. Morever, parents constantly worry about these schools closing or relocating,"" she explained.
Shi has recently completed a report about her survey, in which she makes a series of recommendations. ""The government can set up public schools for migrants' children equal to schools for city children. Second, to offset  migrant workers' very low pay, public schools should offer them special rates so they can afford their children's tuition .","{

One day, while she was walking in a garden, she noticed a small butterfly caught in a bush. The more the butterfly tried to free itself, the deeper the thorn cut into its body. The girl carefully helped the butterfly out. Instead of flying away, the little butterfly changed into a beautiful fairy .

"Discoveries in science and technology are thought by ""untaught minds"" to come in blinding flashes or as the result of dramatic accidents. Sir Alexander Fleming did not, as legend would have it, look at themold ( ) on a piece of cheese and get the idea for penicillin there and then. He experimented with antibacterial substances for nine years before he made his discovery. Inventions and innovations almost always come out of tough trial and error. Innovation is like soccer; even the best players miss the goal and have their shots blocked much more frequently than they score.
     The point is that the players who score most are the ones who take most shots at the goal--and so it goes with innovation in any field of activity. The prime difference between innovation and others is one of approach. Everybody gets ideas, but innovators work consciously on theirs, and they follow them through until they prove practicable or otherwise. What ordinary people see as fanciful abstractions, professional innovators see as solid possibilities.
     ""Creative thinking may mean simply the realization that there's no particular goodness in doing things the way they have always been done."" Wrote Rudolph Flesch, a language authority. This accounts for our reaction to seemingly simple innovations like plastic garbage bags and suitcases on wheels that make life more convenient: ""How come nobody thought of that before?""
     The creative approach begins with the proposal that nothing be as it appears. Innovators will not accept that there is only one way to do anything. Faced with getting from A to B, the average person will automatically set out on the best-known and apparently simplest route. The innovator will search for alternate courses, which may prove easier in the long run and are sure to be more interesting and challenging even if they lead to dead ends. Highly creative individuals really do march to a different drummer.","{

"A man enters a store to buy milk. He walks out of the store with milk. That is all-- milk. At the same time, a woman enters the same grocery store also to buy milk. She buys it. But, she also buys chicken and lemons to make dinner that night. Then she remembers to buy food for her son to eat at school. She also gets a bottle of wine for drinks with friends and a birthday card for her husband's niece. Then she gets coffee for breakfast, ice cream for dessert and remembers stamps to mail the bills. And don't forget soap for the bathroom.
And that is the difference between the female and male brains simply explained in a grocery store. Generally speaking,men do one thing at a time. Women do many. Doing many things at one time is often called ""multi-tasking"", a very popular word these days.
Now scientific research supports this theory about male and female brains. A recent study has confirmed what we have known all along--men and women think differently.
Scientist at the university of Pennsylvania studied brain images of 949 people aged from 8 to 22 years old. They found that male brains have more connections on one side of the brain, or hemisphere. In female brain, they found more activity and connections between the right and left sides of the brain. The left side of the brain is known as the side of ""reason"" The right hemisphere is known as the ""creative"" side.
Regina Verma is a professor at the University of Pennsylvania. She co-wrote the report. She says when women are asked to do something difficult they might use different parts of the brain. Men, she adds, generally use just one side of the brain.
As a result, men generally deal directly with a problem. There is a strong connection between the ""understanding"" and the ""action"" parts of their brains. Women, however, might include other parts of the brain, like the part connected with reason and the part connected with sensitivity when solving a problem. Women take a less direct path to find a solution.
Dr. Venma warns that the study should not lead anyone to expect some behaviors from women and others from men.","{

"My father always told me never to ever reveal my true opinions towards other people unless such opinions are positive. He said this is the ""Chu Shi Zhe Xue"", the philosophy of dealing with social network.
  It seems that everybody here just follows this philosophy very, very well.
 I would say that if I were given true friendship I would definitely treasure it with my greatest care. If I really regard someone as my close friend, I would never leave her alone whenever she's in need, either financially or mentally. And I always believe, as long as I treat people with whole-hearted honesty, I would have some rewards--at least, just ONE true friend of the same gender.
 Sometimes I just miss my friends in China. Perhaps when we became friends, we were still young, too young to have been polluted by any dirt in the society. But here, it is simply different. It seems that all of us have learned how to survive in a foreign land and such an experience actually makes us learn how to get the most benefits from the surroundings in order to survive.
 All are friends around me. I've looked through all the dark sides of their personalities and yet I have to pretend that I know nothing. I say to myself:They are good and we are friends"". And then I can make myself comfortable enough to talk to people I hate the most. And of course, they don't say any words truly from their hearts. Neither do I.

"You've probably grown accustomed to texting in the glow of a mobile phone screen. Well, there's some good and bad news coming for those of you who spend hours speedily tapping messages to one another. 
The good news is that the hours you spend face-to-phone are paying off. You may have become fluent in a second language. 
The bad news, however, is that this language is texting. Worse still, there isn't yet a texting section in your school exams, so you'll need to work harder to recover the grammar skills you might be killing with every LOL and BRB (Be right back). 
A new study confirms what many parents suspect. The more kids send and receive texts, the poorer their grammar skills become. 
With ""the culture of mobile communication--quick back and forth  , there are compromises on traditional, cultural writing"", said S. Shyam Sundar, professor of Pennsylvania State University, which conducted the study. 
""Techspeak"", as Sundar and his research partner Drew P. Cingel call it, has become so prevalent   among young users that it's changing their foundation of basic grammar. 
""Routine use of textual   adaptations by current and future generations of 13-to-17-year-olds may serve to create the impression that this is normal and accepted use of the language, ""they said in their published findings. 
It seems teenagers are unable to ""code  switch-shift"" between standard grammar and the abbreviations   used in text messages, Sundar said. These abbreviations have become the real words for them now. 
However, linguists   aren't particularly disturbed by the trend, Sundar added. ""The linguists will tell you the language is very dynamic. ""
Still, students have exams to worry about. Here's a sample  of the questions, so you can test yourself to see how texting has affected your grammar: 
*During the flood, we (dranked, drank, drunk, drunked) bottled water. 
*Fortunately, Jim's name was (accepted, excepted) from the list of those who would have to clean bathrooms because he was supposed to go downtown to (accept, except) a reward for the German Club. 
*The dress is so large that it is (lose, loose) on me when I wear it!","{

"A famous doctor once received a little child who was badly ill. Thanks to his skill and care, his young patient got well and was soon able to get up and run about again.
The child's mother was very much obliged to the doctor, and she called on him to thank him for what he had done for her child. ""Doctor,"" she said, ""you have saved my little son. I don't know how to thank you enough. I feel that money alone cannot repay you, so I have made this little purse with my own hands, as a sign of my gratitude. I hope you will accept it."" The doctor stood up and said coldly, ""Madam, a little present like that is very nice between friends, but a doctor needs to be paid properly for what he has done."" The lady was so surprised and hurt so much that she could not reply for a moment. Then she said quietly, ""Perhaps you will tell me how much your fee is?""
""Fifty pounds"", he answered.
The lady opened the little purse and took out four fifty-pound bank notes. She handed one of them to the doctor, and put the other three back into the purse. She put the purse into her handbag and, saying good bye to the doctor, went out of the room.","{

"Have you ever run into a careless cell phone user on the street? Perhaps they were busy talking, testing or checking updates on WeChat without looking at what was going on around them. As the number of this new ""species"" of human has kept rising, they have been given a new name -- phubbers  .
Recently, a cartoon created by students from China Central Academy of Fine Arts put this group of people under the spotlight. In the short film, phubbers with various social identities bury themselves in their phones. A doctor plays with his cell phone while letting his patient die, a pretty woman takes selfie in front of a car accident siteand a father loses his child without knowing about it while using his mobile phone. A chain of similar events eventually leads to the destruction of the world.
Although the ending sounds overstated, the damage phubbing can bring is real. Your health is the first to bear the effect and result of it. ""Constantly bending your head to check your cell phone could damage your neck,"" Guangming Daily quoted doctors as saying. ""The neck is like a rope that breaks after long-term stretching."" Also, staring at cell phones for long periods of time will damage your eyesight gradually, according to the report.
But that's not all. Being a phubber could also damage your social skills and drive you away from your friends and family. At reunions with family or friends, many people tend to stick to their cell phones while others are chatting happily with each other and this creates a strange atmosphere, Qilu Evening News reported.
It can also cost you your life. There have been lots of reports on phubbers who fell to their death, suffered accidents, and were robbed of their cell phones in broad daylight.","{

"Naps--short sleeps during the day--may improve memory, experts said recently. 
New research conducted by brain researcher Avi Karni of the University of Haifa in Israel explores the possibility that naps help lock in sometimes long-term memories. ""We still don't know exactly how memory system works during sleep, but the results of this research suggest it is possible to speed up memory consolidation ,"" Karni said. Long-term memory refers  to memories that stay with us for years, such as ""what"" memories -- a car accident that happened yesterday-- or ""how to"" memories, such as one's learned ability to play the pianos.
Karni, also one of the authors of the study published in a recent issue of the journal Nature Neuroscience, instructed participants to learn a difficult set of finger games, then divided the study _ into two groups: one that napped for an hour, and one that didn't. The people who took an afternoon snooze showed obvious improvement in their performance by that evening.
""After a night's sleep the two groups were at the same level, but the group that slept in the afternoon improved much faster than the group that stayed awake,"" Karni said. And the study also showed just how much faster a 90-minute nap could help lock in long-term memories. ""Daytime sleep can shorten the time 'how to' memory weakens and forgetting starts,""Karni said, ""Instead of 6 to 8 hours, the brain consolidated the memory during the 90-minute nap.""","{

"""NOW I just don't believe that. ""Surely all of us, at some point, have watched a movie and thought: It's simply badly researched,or the makers must think we're fools. Recently, The Daily Telegraph ran a humorous piece on untrue tech moments from some top movies. Let's see what they are all about.
Tom Chiver, the writer of The Daily Telegraph uses his first example from the movie Independence Day, in which a character comes up with a virus which destroys Windows the computer system the alien  spacecraft uses. ""It's a good thing that they didn't have Norton Anti-virus,"" jokes  Chivers.
It's just one case of a movie that takes a lot of license with its science. Another one Chivers mentions is from the movie Star Wars, where the glowing light beams  traveling through space look very impressive. But the problem is that in space there are no air particles  for the light to reflect off. In reality, they'd be invisible , which wouldn't look so cool on the big screen.
Most people think that the mind--bending Matrix films are made for great viewing. But for Chivers, the science in the movies is a little bit silly. He comments ""...the film is based on the idea that humans are kept alive as electricity generators  . This is not just unlikely --it's basically impossible. _ would need more energy to stay alive than they would produce. It's just like saying that you'll power the car with batteries, and keep the batteries charged by running a generator from the wheels. ""
And finally, as Chivers points out, DNA is not replaceable. But this bit of elementary genetics passed the makers of the 2002 Bond film Die Another Day by. In the film the bad guy has ""gene treatment"" to change his appearance and his DNA, which is completely impossible in our real world.","{

"Time never had any importance to me until I received a watch from my father that organized my life and made me more responsible.
I received this gift on a gray-sky day. I had to go to the airport at 9:00 a.m. to pick up my uncle Ali and take him to my father's house. However, I was late because I was hanging out with my friends. Later that day, around 11:00 a.m., I remembered my uncle, but I was very late. He had already left the airport and taken a taxi to my father's house.
I got to my father's house at 2:00 p.m. on the same day and looked at my angry father's face. I felt ashamed.

"Today, people all over the world are moving out of small villages in the country to go and live in big, noisy cities. They are moving from the peaceful hills, mountains, fields, rivers and streams of the countryside to the busy world of streets, buildings, traffic and crowds. This movement from rural  areas to urban areas has been going on for over two hundred years.
In many countries, the main reason people come to live in towns and cities is work. After one or two large factories have been built in or near a town, people come to find work, and soon an industrial area begins to grow. There is usually _ nearby, too. The families of these workers need schools, hospitals and shops, so many people come to live in the area to provide these services and a city grows.
In every major city in the world, there is a business district where the big companies have their main offices. In the United States, this area is usually in the city center downtown. It is here that you can see many huge skyscrapers and office blocks. The people who work here often travel a long way to work each day. Many of them live in the suburbs of the city, far away from the industrial area and the city center. Some suburbs are very pleasant, with nice houses and big gardens. There are usually parks for children to play in and large department stores where you can buy all you need.
But what is the future of the big cities? Will they continue to get bigger and bigger? Perhaps not. Some major cities have actually become smaller in the last ten years, and it is quite possible that one day we will see people moving out of the major cities and back into smaller towns and villages.","{

"A woman named Emily renewing her driver's license at the County Clerk's office was asked to state her occupation. She hesitated, uncertain how to classify herself.
""What I mean is,"" explained the recorder, ""do you have a job, or are you just a ...""
""Of course I have a job,"" said Emily. ""I'm a mother.""
""We don't list 'mother' as an occupation... 'housewife' covers it,"" said the recorder.
One day I found myself in the same situation. The clerk was obviously a career woman, confident and possessed of a high sounding title. ""What is your occupation?"" she asked.
The words simply popped out. ""I'm a Research Associate in the field of Child Development and Human Relations.""
The clerk paused, ballpoint pen frozen in midair.
I repeated the title slowly, then I stared with wonder as my statement was written in bold, black ink on the official questionnaire.
""Might I ask,"" said the clerk with new interest, ""Just what you do in this field?""
Coolly, without any trace of panic in my voice, I heard myself reply, ""I have a continuing program of research (what mother doesn't), in the lab and in the field (normally I would have said indoors and out). Of course, the job is one of the most demanding in the humanities (any mother care to disagree?), and I often work 14 hours a day (24 is more like it). But the job is more challenging than most careers and rewards are more of a satisfaction rather than just money.""
There was an increasing note of respect in the clerk's voice as she completed the form, stood up, and showed me out.
As I drove into our driveway, buoyed up   by my glamorous new career, I was greeted by my lab assistants---ages 13, 7, and 3.
Upstairs I could hear our new experimental model (a 6 month old baby), in the child-development program, testing out a new vocal pattern.

"""I've changed my mind.I wanted to have a telescope,but now I want my dad back."" Lucien Lawrence's letter to his father for Christmas written after his father had been knifed to death outside his school gate,must have touched everyone's  heart.Lucien went on to say that without his father he couldn't see the stars in the sky.When those whom we love depart from us,we cannot see the stars for a while.
But Lucien,the stars are still there,and one day,when you are older and your tears have gone,you will see them again.And,in a strange way,I expect that you will find your father there,too,in your mind and heart.I find that my parents,who died years ago,still figure in many of my dreams and that I think of them perhaps more than I ever did when they were alive.I still live to please them and I'm still surprised by their reactions.I remember that when I became a professor,I was so proud,or rather so pleased with myself that I couldn't wait to cable my parents.The reply was a long time in coming,but when it did,all my mother said was ""I hope this means that now you will have more time for the children!"" I haven't forgotten.The values of my parents still live on.
It makes me pause and think about how I will live on in the hearts and minds of my children and of those for whom I care.Would I have been as ready as Philip Lawrence have been to face the aggressors,and to lay down my life for those in my care?How many people would want me back for Christmas?It's a serious thought,one to give me pause.
I pray silently,sometimes,in the dead of night,that ancient cry of a poet ""Deliver my soul from the sword,and my darling from the power of the dog."" Yet I know the death comes to us all,and sometimes comes suddenly.We must therefore plan to live forever,but live as if we will die tomorrow.We live on,I'm sure,in the lives of those we love,and therefore we ought to have a care for what they will remember and what they will treasure.If more parents knew this in their hearts to be true,there might be fewer knives on our streets today.","{

"Studying abroad is an amazing experience, especially when you come to Australia as an overseas(  ) high school student. You can have a lot of fun here, especially on holidays.
There are many festivals in Australia. The most important one is obviously Christmas. Each year, the summer holidays at every high school last about two months from the beginning of December to February, which covers the Christmas time. Since it is a long holiday, most overseas students love to fly back to their home countries to spend the time with their families and friends, but a few students still stay in Australia during the holiday to get part-time jobs. It is quite easy to find a part-time job at Christmas. Students often take part in another major social activity. They go to the beach to have fun in the sunshine. The summer in Australia is from December to February, so going to the beach in December is very popular among Australians.
Easter in March is another important holiday in the year. It actually combines  ""Good Friday"" and ""Easter Monday"". Almost every shop closes on Good Friday. And people usually go to see Easter Show.
The Chinese New year is not a public holiday in Australia, so every Chinese student still has to go to school to study and do his or her normal duties.","{

"LEEDS, England--A Leeds University psychology professor is researching a course to help dozens of Britons forgive their enemies.
""The hate we hold within us is a cancer."" Professor Ken Hart said, adding that holding in anger can lead to problems such as high blood pressure and heart disease.
More than 70 people have become volunteers in Hart's first 20-week workshop in London--a course he says is the first of its kind in the world.
These are people who are sick and tired of living with a memory. They realize their bitterness is a poison they think they can pour out, but they end up drinking it themselves, said Canadian-born Hart.
The students meet in each group of eight to ten for a two-hour workshop with a director every two weeks.
The course, ending in July, is expected to get rid of the cancer of hate in these people. ""People have lots of negative attitudes towards forgiveness,"" he said, ""People confuse forgiveness with forgetting. Forgiveness means changing from a negative attitude to a positive one.""
Hart and his team have created instructions to provide the training needed.
""The main idea is to give you guidances on how to look at all kinds of angers and how they affect you, and how to change your attitudes towards the person you are angry with,"" said Norman Claringbull, a senior expert on the forgiveness project.
Hart said, ""I believe forgiveness is a skill that can be taught, as these people want to get free of the past.""","{

"People often say that the Englishman's home is his castle. They mean that the home is very important and personal to him. Most people in Britain live in houses rather than flats, and many people own their homes. This means that they can make them individual; they can paint them, and change them in any way they like. Most houses have a garden, even if it is a very small one, and the garden is usually loved. The house and the garden are the private space of the individual.
People usually like to mark their space. Are you sitting now in your home or on a train? Have you marked the space around yourself as yours ? If you are on the train you may put your coat or small bag on the seat beside you. If you share a flat you may have one corner or chair which is your own.
Once I was traveling on a train to London. I was in a section for four people and there was a table between us .The man on the space on my side of the table at all. I was angry. Maybe he thought that he owned the whole table .I had read a book about non-verbal communication, so I took various papers out of my bag and put them on his briefcase! When I did this he stiffened and his eyes nearly popped out of his head. I had invaded his space! A few minutes later I took my papers off his case in order to read them. He immediately moved his case to his side of the table. Of course, it is possible that he just wanted to be helpful to me!
If you are visiting another country you may feel that you don't have any private space. Hotel rooms look much the same in every country in the world. All day long ,you share public spaces with other people. You see the local people in their private spaces and _ . Local people can create their private spaces by talking about things you don't know about .And you even feel that they like you to be outside _ so that they will enjoy being inside even more!

"I felt excited, curious and nervous at the same time. I was excited because I would be skipping two grades. I was curious because I didn't know how high school students were taught. However, I was most nervous at the idea that I would be doing high school homework.
I had just walked into the class when the bell rang. This wasn't a good start. But the kid in front of me looked very friendly. Luckily, since it was the first day of school, my teacher talked for about half of the period and  we just had the rest of the period to start the class. I didn't know what he was saying at first, but when I saw the problems on the paper, I knew what to do.
The next day, the kid said hi and I said hi back. We got into a conversation. It seemed that whenever I was talking to my friend, everyone stopped staring at  me. Then the class started. It was easy. But I was still uncomfortable because I couldn't look around without meeting others'eyes, so I just kept my eyes on the whiteboard and on my textbook.
However, my friend didn't show up the next day, and the eighth graders just kept on staring at me. I didn't know why.
The next day everything changed. My friend was back to school. I was praised for my homework. Everyone stared at me less. Some started to be a little friendlier towards me. I felt at home at last here. My teachers also seemed pretty nice.","{

"In the Caucasus region of Russia, nearly 50 out of every 100,000 people live to celebrate their 100th birthday, and many don't stop at 100! By comparison, in America only 3 people in 100,000 reach 100. But these Russian old people aren't alone. The Pakistanis, who live high in the Himalaya Mountains, and the Ecuadorans of the Andes Mountains seem to share the secret of long life, too.
These people remain healthy in body and spirit despite the passage of time. While many older persons in industrial societies become weak and ill in their 60s and 70s, some Caucasians aged 100 to 140, work in the fields beside their great-great-grandchildren. Even the idea of aging is foreign to them. When asked ""at what age does youth end?""most of these old people had no answer. Several replied, ""Well, perhaps at age 80.""
What accounts for this ability to survive to such old age, and to survive so well?First of all, hard physical work is a way of life for all of these long-lived people. They begin their long days of physical labor as children and never seem to stop. For example, Mr . Rustam Mamedov is 142 years of age. His wife is 116 years old. They have been married for 90 years. Mr. Mamedov has no intention of retiring from his life as a farmer. ""Why?What else would I do?""he asks. All these people get healthful rewards from the environment in which they work. They all come from mountainous regions. They live and work at elevations of 1,660 to 1,000 meters above sea level. The air has less oxygen and is pollution-free. This reduced-oxygen environment makes the heart and blood vessel  system stronger.
Another factor that may contribute to the good health of these people is their isolation. To a great extent, they are separated from the pressures and worries of industrial society. Inherited factors also play some role. Most of the longest-lived people had parents and grandparents who also reached very old ages. Good family genes may, therefore, be one factor in living longer.","{

"About ten years ago, a young and very successful businessman named Josh was traveling down a prefix = st1 /Chicagoneighborhood street. He was going a bit too fast in his shiny, black, 12 cylinder Jaguar XKE, which was only two months old.
He was watching for kids rushing out from between parked cars and slowed down when he thought he saw something. As his car passed, no child came out, but a brick sailed out and-WHUMP!-it hit the Jag's shiny black side door! SCREECH. . . !!!! Immediately Josh stopped the car, jumped out, seized the kid and pushed him up against a parked car. He shouted at the kid, ""What was that all about and who are you? Just what the heck are you doing?!"" Building up a head of steam, he went on. ""That's my new Jag, that brick you threw is gone cost you a lot of money. Why did you throw it?""
""Please, mister, please. . . I'm sorry! I didn't know what else to do!"" begged the youngster. ""I threw the brick because no one else would stop!"" Tears were streaming down the boy's face as he pointed around the parked car. ""It's my brother, mister,"" he said. ""He rolled off the curb  and fell out of his wheelchair and I can't lift him up. "" Sobbing, the boy asked the businessman, ""Would you please help me get him back into his wheelchair?"" He's hurt and he's too heavy for me. ""
Moved beyond words, the young businessman tried hard to swallow the rapidly swelling lump in his throat. Straining, he lifted the young man back into the wheelchair and took out his handkerchief and wiped the scrapers and cuts, checking to see that everything was going to be OK. He then watched the younger brother push him down the sidewalk toward their home. 
It was a long walk back to the black, shining, 12 cylinder Jaguar XKE -- a long and slow walk. Josh never fixed the side door of his Jaguar. He kept the dent  to remind him not to go through life so fast that someone has to throw a brick at him to get his attention.  _","{

"Cities alarmed by deaths and injuries of pedestrians are taking efforts to make crosswalks safer for people on foot, especially seniors and children who need more time to cross streets.
   A pedestrian is killed in a traffic accident in the USA every 110 minutes;one is injured every nine minutes, according to official data. Crosswalk can be especially dangerous for the elderly. Among people 70 and older, 36% of pedestrian deaths in 2006 occurred in crosswalks, compared with 21% of those younger than 70, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety.
   The Federal Highway Administration(FHWA)advises that next year states increase by nearly 15% the amount of time traffic lights provide for pedestrians to cross the street after the flashing orange hand appears .
   FHWA spokesman Doug Hecox says reasons for the change include an aging population that needs more time to cross, health-conscious Americans walking more, children encouraged to walk to prevent getting overweight and high gas prices pushing people to walk instead of driving.
   Pedestrian deaths went down by 12% from 5,449 in 1996 to 4,784 in 2006. But among those in 2006, 471 were killed in crosswalks, down slightly from 488 ten years earlier, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) says .","{

"The OM Man and the Sea ,for which Hemingway was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature, is one of the most influential novels of the literary treasure of the world. Famously known for his brief and short sentences ,Hemingway created ah interesting and unique style of writing that still appeal to readers today.
Santiago was an aged Cuban fisherman, and many thought that he could no longer fish. For eighty-four days ,he set out to sea and returned empty-handed. So unlucky was he that the parents of his young, devoted apprentice   and friend , Manolin , forced the boy to leave the old man in order to fish in a more profitable boat On the eighty-fifth day ,the fisherman set out into the open sea to go fishing. At noon ,a big Marlin took hold of one of the lines, but the fish was far too big for him to handle.
Santiago let the fish have enough line, so that it wouIdn9t break his pole; but he and his boat were dragged out to sea for three days. Finally ,the fish grew tired. Santiago killed it Even this final victory didn't end his journey. He was still far, far out to sea. To make matters worse, Santiago dragged the Marlin behind the boat and the fish blood attracted sharks.
Santiago did his best to beat the sharks away ,but his efforts were not enough, The sharks ate the flesh off the Marlin ,and Santiago was left with only the bones. Santiago was tired out He got back home with nothing to show for his pains but the skeletal  remains of a large Marlin. Even with just the bare remains of the fish, the experience changed him, and charged the opinions others had of him. Manolin , who had been worried over the old man's absence, was moved to tears when he found Santiago safe in his bed, When the old man woke ,the two agreed to fish as partners once more.
With Santiago5S struggle to catch the Marlin and his journey home ,Santiago's courage was obvious as he faced challenges that just didn't seem to end. He didn't give up and even though he felt he had been very unlucky, there was hope to keep going on. He was destroyed but not defeated.","{

"Who would win in a competition to memorize numbers, a chimp   or a teenager? The teenager? Think again. Scientists have proved that chimps perform better than human beings when it comes to this kind of problem. We may have to rethink what we believe about human memory.
Memory is our ability to learn something, save it and recall it when needed. Our memories are important to our sense of self, our personalities, and our ability to understand the world.
Scientists say that there are different types of memory. There is short-term memory and long-term memory. Your short-term memory saves information for a few seconds or a few minutes. For example, the time it takes to compare the prices of a few items in a store. Long-term memory involves the information you try hard to keep, because it's meaningful to you (an example is data  about family and friends. ) And then there is visual memory and sound memory. But these are not hard and fast: scientists argue a lot about the nature of memory.
Scientists have also found that people memorize things in different ways. Some memorize better with the help of pictures. Others are helped more by sounds. One thing's for sure. If you can combine different kinds of memory together, you will remember a lot! So why not try pictures with English words? At the same time listen to recordings of the same group of words. It may help when it comes to memorizing it.
Imagination and association can be useful too. By imagination scientists mean picturing a word in your mind. Association means relating the word to something you already know.","{

"One important variable affecting communication across cultures is destiny   and personal responsibility. This refers to the degree to which we feel ourselves the masters of our lives, contrary to the degree to which we see ourselves as _ to things outside our control. Another way to look at this is to ask how much we see ourselves able to change and act, to choose the course of our lives and relationships. Some have drawn a parallel between the personal responsibility in North American settings and the view itself. The North American view is vast, with large spaces of unpopulated land. The frontier attitude of ""King"" of the wilderness, and the expansiveness of the land reaching huge distances, may relate to generally high levels of confidence in the ability to shape and choose our destinies.
In this expansive land, many children grow up with a heroic sense of life, where ideas are big, and hope springs forever. When they experience temporary failures, they are encouraged to redouble their efforts, to ""Try, try again."" Action, efficiency, and achievement are valued and expected. Free will is respected in laws and enforced by courts.
Now consider places in the world with much smaller land, whose history reflects wars and tough struggles: Northern Ireland, Mexico, Israel, Palestine. In these places, destiny's role is more important in human life. In Mexico, there is a history of hard life, fighting over land, and loss of homes. Mexicans are more likely to see struggles as part of their life and unavoidable. Their passive attitude is expressed in their way of responding to failure or an accident by saying ""ni modo"" (""no way"" or ""tough lick""), meaning that the failure was destined.
This variable is important to understanding cultural conflicts. If someone believing in free will crosses paths with someone more passive, miscommunication is likely. The first person may expect action and responsibility. Failing to see it, he may conclude that the second is lazy, not cooperative, or dishonest. The second person will expect respect for the natural order of things. Failing to see it, he may conclude that the first is forcible, rude, or big headed in his ideas of what can be accomplished or changed.","{

WHO officials say tobacco use will have killed more than 8,000,000 people a year by 2020 if nothing is done to control the problem.
In the United States, more than forty-sixty million adults currently smoke. American health experts say tobacco use is the leading cause of death in the United States. This year, 440,000 Americans will die of diseases linked to smoking.
Smoking tobacco is the leading cause of lung disease. Smoking also has been linked to heart disease and many kinds of cancers. The American Cancer Society says smoking is responsible for about 87% of all lung cancers in the United States.
American government health experts say smoking affects not only the smokers. Women who smoke cigarettes during pregnancy are more likely to have babies with health problems. Pregnant women who smoke are at risk of having a baby who weighs less than normal. Low birth weight babies have an increased risk of early death and may suffer from a number of health disorders.
Experts say tobacco smoke also affects the health of people who do not smoke. Smokers may harm the health of family members and people at work when they breathe out smoke from cigarettes. This is called ""second-hand smoke"".
The American Cancer Society says there is no safe way to smoke. It says smoking begins to cause damage immediately. All cigarettes can damage the body. Smoking even a small number of cigarettes is dangerous.","{

"Women are still underrepresented in top academic positions. One of the possible explanations for this is the increasing importance of obtaining research funding. Women are often less successful in this than men. Psychology researchers Dr. Romyvan der Lee and professor Naomi Ellemers investigated whether this difference also occurs at the Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) and examined potential explanations.
The researchers were assigned by NWO to carry out this study as part of the broader evaluation of NWO's procedures and its gender diversity policy. The aim was to gain more insight into the causes of the differences in awarding rates for male and female applicants for research funding. The analysis addressed an important ""talent programme"" of NWO, the Veni grant. ""Whoever receives this grant has a greater chance of obtaining an important appointment at a university,""says Naomi Ellemers.
Van der Lee and Ellemers investigated all the applications submitted by male and female researchers over a period of three years: a total of 2823 applications. Under the direction of NWO these applications were assessed by scientific committees consisting of men and women. The results demonstrate that the awarding rates for female applicants (14.9%) are systematically lower than those for male applicants (17.7%). ""If we compare the proportion of women among the applicants with the proportion of women among those awarded funding, we see a loss of 4%,"" said Ellemers.
The study reveals that women are less positively evaluated for their qualities as researcher than men are. ""Interestingly the research proposals of women and men are evaluated equally positively. In other words, the reviewers see no difference in the quality of the proposals that men and women submit,"" says Romy van der Lee.
In search for a possible cause for the differences in awarding rates and evaluations, the researchers also investigated the language use in the instructions and forms used to assess the quality of applications. This clearly revealed the occurrence of gendered language. The words that are used to indicate quality are frequently words that were established in previous research as referring mainly to the male gender stereotype (such as challenging and excellent). Romy van der Lee explains: ""As a result, it appears that men more easily satisfy the assessment criteria, because these better fit the characteristics stereotypically associated with men.""
In response to the results of this research, NWO will devote more attention to the gender awareness of reviewers in its methods and procedures. It will also be investigated which changes to the assessment procedures and criteria can most strongly contribute to more equal chances for men and women to obtain research funding. This will include an examination of the language used by NWO. NWO chair Jos Engelens said, ""The research has yielded valuable results and insights. Based on the recommendations made by the researchers we will therefore focus in the coming period on the development of evidence-based measures to reduce the difference in awarding rates.""","{

"Galaxy saw a man and a woman who communicated with the sign language at the train station when she was on the way home one evening. She noticed that the woman asked the mon for the direction. He told her that he did not know. Galaxy decided to help them. She had learned the sign language when she served as a volunteer in the deaf and mute school. Then she showed the woman the direction and left her email address to them in case they needed her help later.
She received an email from that man the next day. Kazrim was his name. Galaxy replied his mail sincerely. They both started chatting online soon after and began seeing each other. Although they only communicated with the sign language, it never bothered her.
Galaxy was fond of him gradually. Obviously, Kazrim was the same too. He presented Galaxy with a bunch of sunflowers and asked her sincerely, ""Are you willing to be my girlfriend?"" Galaxy was pleasantly surprised. She requested him to give her some time to persuade her parents.
As she had expected, her parents were very angry after they had learned of their love story. Galaxy explained, ""Kazrim is an excellent and a very optimistic person. He has a very positive attitude towards life and work. He cares for others always. He is 100% better than the normal. Moreover, the mute is still a human. He should possess a perfect and wonderful love. ""
Her parents asked to see him, then. The very worried Galaxy took Kazrim home a few days later. When they were on the train, Kazrim told her, ''I'm going to tell your parents I'll be looking after you well with all my life!"" Galaxy was deeply moved.
As soon as they had entered the house, Galaxy introduced him to her parents. She said, ''This is Kazrim."" Just right after her speech, an unbelievable thing happened. Kazrim threw the gift away and held her in his arms tightly.
He said, ""YOU CAN TALK?"" It was the same question that Galaxy wanted to ask, too.

"Almost no young people today know who the cartoon character Oswald the Rabbit is, but they certainly recognize his successor, Bugs Bunny. Oswald, Bugs, and hundreds of other characters were created by Walt Disney, perhaps the most famous cartoonist in history.
Born in prefix = st1 /Chicagoin 1901, Walt Disney always wanted to be an artist. After returning from World War I, in which he drove an ambulance, Disney worked as a commercial artist. He enjoyed drawing cartoons more than anything else, and decided to try his hand at a technology that was new at the time, moving pictures.
In the 1920's, he produced several films where he made cartoon characters move as if by magic. The technique Disney used was painstaking. He made hundreds or even thousands of repeated drawings of the same character. In each drawing, the character was changed just a bit. A film was taken of the series of drawings, and when it was shown, the characters appeared to move. The process, called animation, is still used today, although computers have made the process much easier.
In 1928, Disney created his most famous character, Mortimer Mouse, who we know today as Mickey. The mouse starred in a cartoon called Steamboat Willie, which was unusual because it involved the use of a sound track. Within the next few years, Disney invented many of his other characters.
The list of Disney's animation successes is long and memorable. It includes Pinocchio, Dumbo, Bambi, Cinderella, and Peter Pan. Perhaps his most remarkable animated film is Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Created in 1937, it was an immediate success. Today, more than fifty years later, it is still one of the most popular films for children.","{

"Have you ever thought, ""I wish I could take a year off and just travel around the world""? Well, three lucky American teenagers were able to do just that. The teens--two males and one female--got an all-expenses paid, yearlong hike to five continents.
This trip didn't include any five-star hotels or shopping funs. Eighteen-year-old Jamie Fiel from Keller, Texas, 17-year-old Arsen Ewing from Canyon, California, and 16-year-old Tyler Robinson from Lincoln, Massachusetts, didn't expect fancy treatment. They signed up for the experience of a lifetime, which included hard work, often uncomfortable accommodations, and encounters with some of nature's most dangerous animals and environments.
Jamie, Arsen, and Tyler were among hundreds of high school kids nominated by their science teachers to take this trip. Earthwatch Institute sponsored   this adventure. Each year, Earthwatch employs thousands of volunteers worldwide to help with scientific research projects.
The group went all around the world to get a close look at the most pressing environmental issues of our time. Their assignments were as varied as their locations, and included measuring and attending pink flamingos in Kenya's Great Rift Valley, and tracking giant sea turtles in Costa Rica.
As they worked with the Earthwatch scientists, Jamie, Arsen, and Tyler began to understand that we are at a critical moment in the life of our planet. Time for change is running out. As the teens went from country to country and witnessed different environmental dangers and challenges, they understood that solutions to important environmental issues start with the power of one person's actions.

"Educating girls quite possibly outputs a higher rate of return than any other investment   available in the developing world. Women's education may be an unusual field for economists, but raising women's contribution to development is actually as much an economic as a social problem. And economics, with its emphasis on motivation, provides an explanation for why so many girls can't receive education.
Parents in low-income countries fail to invest in their daughters because they do not expect them to make an economic contribution to the family: girls grow up only to marry into somebody else's family and bear children. Girls are thus seen as less valuable than boys and are kept at home to do housework while their brothers are sent to school-- _ , trapping women in a vicious circle   of neglect.
An educated mother, on the other hand, has greater earning abilities outside the home and faces an entirely different set of choices. She is likely to have fewer but healthier children and can insist on the development of all her children, ensuring that her daughters are given a fair chance. The education of her daughters then makes it much more likely that the next generation of girls, as well as of boys, will be educated and healthy. The vicious circle is thus transformed into a good circle.
Few will disagree with it that educating women has great social benefits. But it has enormous economic advantages as well. Most obviously, there is the direct effect of education on the wages of female workers. Wages rise by 10 to 20 per cent for each additional year of schooling. Such big returns are impressive by the standard of other available investments, but they are just the beginning. Educating women also has a significant influence on health practices, including family planning.","{

"These days, if you still think the cellphone is just for talking, you will get laughed at. Yes, it's true, voice-only handsets have become out of date. Today's do-it-all mobiles have a lot in common with the computer. The only difference may be that they fit in your pocket and you pay by the minutes to use them. Some of the things a cellphone can do for you will be available this year:
         Surf at speed
         Cellpones that let you use the Web have been around for years. So, what's new? Well, faster third-generation(3G) net works let you surf at anywhere. This then allows a carrier to send video, music, and games to your phone. Possible choices are from LG Electronic VX 8000 and Motorola V 1150.
         Listen as you go
         The problem with most cellphone MP3 players is that they hold only a handful of songs. But, that's about to change. Sony Ericsson's new W800i can hold around 150 songs in its 500 MB memory. And Sumsung's SPH-V5400 even comes with a 1.5 GB hard drive. Mobile phones may eventually replace mini-MP3 players, especially for teens.
         Say cheese
         Camera cellphones are not new either. But, most of them have limitations: around 1-megapixel . But new technology has made 2-megapixel units more common and 3-megapixel units are showing up soon. Some 2-megapixel models, like Sony Ericsson's K750i, offer limited zoom and focus controls. Others, like LG's recent MMA7110, can even capture 30 minutes of full- motion video.
         Portable TV
         You say you like ""watching TV""? That's what Sumsung MM-A700 wants to give you. The new model lets users watch popular TV programs--for a fee. Other choices are Nokia's 6620, Sanyo's MM 7400 and NEC's N940.The NEC model lets you watch public TV--no fee.
         The above are just a handful of what you will see in the coming months. Further down the road, your mobile phone may play a host of other roles, such as mobile credit card, position locator... So what is there that a cellphone can't do?","{

"Babies born in summer are more likely to become short-sighted in late life, a study has shown.
As many as a quarter of all cases of short-sightedness are caused by too great an exposure to sunlight in the first weeks of life, say eye experts.
They are advising all parents to put sunglasses on their babies during the first weeks.
Scientists had already established that over-exposure to sunlight caused shortsightedness in animals.
Researchers who compared the months in which babies were born with whether they needed glasses later on say the principle also applies to humans.
A study of almost 300,000 young adults-the largest of its kind-showed that those born in June and July had a 25 per cent greater chance of becoming severely short-sighted than those born in December or January.
Research leader Professor Michael Belkin, of Tel Aviv University, said it was because prolonged illumination  causes the eyeball to lengthen-causing short-sightedness.
Hence the more light a newborn is exposed to, the more the eyeball lengthens and the worse the short-sightedness will be.
The mechanism which lengthens the eyeball is associated with levels of melatonin , a pigment   which protects the skin against harmful rays of the sun.
In young babies not enough melatonin is released as protection, meaning they are more _ to sunburn and changes to eyeball shape.
Sight expert Professor Daniel O'Leary, of Anglia Ruskin University in Cambridge, said ""At the moment we don't know the precise cause of why light exposure affects sight, but the evidence seems to prove that it is one of the reasons for people becoming shortsighted.""","{

"Sabina Castelfrancol Rome October 16, 2011---The U.N. World Food program says there are growing concerns over food insecurity in the developing world. Some of those concerns are discussed in a report to agree with the anniversary Sunday of World Food Day.
The theme for World Food Day 2011 is ""Food prices-From Crisis to Stability"". A ceremony to mark World Food Day will be held Monday at the headquarters of the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization in Rome.
Rising food prices, weather emergencies and political instability are deepening the struggle of families trying to provide for their households in many developing nations.
This year's ""State of Food In security in the World"" report, published last week, focuses on the impact of food price  _ confirming that high, unpredictable prices are likely to continue.
The report highlighted how poor consumers, small farmers and countries dependent on imports, especially in Africa, have been deeply affected by the food and economic crises.
Gregory Barrow is with the World Food Program in Rome.
""if you look at the places where World Food program works particularly in developing countries, you see populations of people who might be spending 60,70,80percent of their salaries on purchasing food for their families"".
Barrow added that if prices become changeful and generally start rising, even by a small amount, it means that many of these people are going to struggle to put nutritious food on their tables.
The report also showed that even short-term fluctuations in prices can have a long-term effect on development, and that cutting back on nutritious food in the first 1.000 days of a child's life can affect mental and physical development and finally, future earning capacity .
The United Nations has programs in place aimed at reducing the number of hungry people by one-half by 2015.But most observers agree this target is unlikely to be reached.","{

"How could we possibly think that keeping animals in cages in unnatural environments-mostly for entertainment purposes-is fair and respectful?
Zoo officials say they are concerned about animals.How ever, most zoos remain ""collections"" of interesting ""things"" rather than protective habitats  .Zoos teach people that it is acceptable to keep animals bored, lonely, and far from their natural bones.
Zoos claim   to educate people and save endangered species , but visitors leave zoos without having learned anything meaningful about the animals' natural behavior, intelligence, or beauty.Zoos keep animals in small spaces or cages, and most signs only mention the species' name, diet, and natural range .The animals' normal behavior is seldom noticed because zoos don't usually take care of the animals' natural needs.
The animals are kept together in small spaces, with no privacy and little opportunity for mental and physical exercise.These results in unusual and self-destructive behavior called zoophobia.A worldwide study of zoos found that zoophobia is common among animals kept in small spaces or cages.Another study showed that elephants spend 22 percent of their time making repeated head movements or biting cage bars, and bears spend 30 percent of their time walking back and forth, a sign of unhappiness and pain.
Furthermore, most animals in zoos are not endangered.Captive breeding of endangered big cats, Asian elephants, and other species has not resulted in their being sent back to the wild.Zoos talk a lot about their captive breeding programs because they do not want people to worry about a species dying out.In fact, baby animals also attract a lot of paying customers.Haven't we seen enough competitions to name baby animals?
Actually, we will save endangered species only if we save their habitats and put an end to the reasons people kill them.Instead of supporting zoos, we should support groups that work to protect animals' natural habitats.","{

"BEIJING -- The rescue operations at a coal mine accident have ended with 105 miners dead. The State Council has organized an investigation team to probe   into what caused the disaster in the city of Linfen, North China's Shanxi Province. Preliminary  investigations show the illegal mining of an unauthorized seam , and the number of miners who had been sent down the shaft far exceeded its capacity.
This mine was found to have long ignored the rules to steal state coal, and did not have a list of miners employed to check the number of miners missing after the accident.
How did such a coal mine get all the necessary licenses for production? How did it pass the three safety inspections the local government organized last month?
In response to this disaster, the Shanxi governor promised to set up hotlines for people to report illegal coal mines and rewards as high as 100,000 yuan for _ 
We appreciate the action this governor has taken to solving the coal mining problems, and we believe that the reporting scheme will help to stop the existence of illegal coal mines.
But at the same time we have reason to question how governments at various levels supervise these mines.
The sad fact that such a mine with serious safety problems could pass three consecutive  local government safety inspections in a month is enough to tell us how ineffective the safety inspections were.
What if these inspections were just a formality ? What if the inspectors were bribed by the mine owners to turn a blind eye to the safety dangers? We can well imagine what would happen if reports about mine problems were handled by such officials.
So a thorough probe must find out who are responsible for the death of so many miners. A real safety inspection and management system must be established to guarantee that safety dangers will be removed.","{

"Researchers have found more evidence that suggests a relationship between race and rates of lung cancer among smokers. A new study shows that black people and Native Hawaiians are more likely to develop lung cancer from smoking. It compared their risk to whites, Japanese, Americans and Latinos.
The study, however, found almost no racial or ethnic differences among the heaviest smokers. These were people who smoked more than thirty cigarettes each day.
Other comparisons have shown that blacks are more likely than whites to get lung cancer from smoking. But the scientists say few studies have compared the risks among Native Hawaiians, Asians and Latinos.
Researchers at the University of Southern California and the University of Hawaii did the new study. The New England Journal of Medicine published the findings.
The eight-year study involved more than 180,000 people. They provided details about their tobacco use and their diet as well as other information. They included current and former smokers and people who never smoked. Almost 2,000 people in the study developed lung cancer.
Researchers say genetics might help explain the racial and ethnic differences. There could be differences in how people's bodies react to smoke. But environmental influences, including the way people smoke, could also make a difference.
African-Americans and Latinos in the study reported smoking the fewest cigarettes per day. Whites were the heaviest smokers. But the scientists note that blacks have been reported to breathe cigarette smoke more deeply than white smokers. This could fill their lungs with more of the chemicals in tobacco that cause cancer.
Many researchers disagree not only about the effect of race on the risk of disease, but even about the meaning of race. Yet scientists know that some diseases affect different groups differently. And some drug companies have begun to develop racially targeted medicines.
Last June, the United State Food and Drug Administration approved a drug designed to treat heart failure in black patients. The name is BiDil. The agency called it ""a step toward the promise of personalized medicine"".","{

The year is 2094. It has been announced that a comet is heading towards the Earth. Most of it will miss our planet, but two fragments will probably hit the southern part of the Earth. The news has caused panic.
On 17 July, a fragment four kilometers wide enters the Earth's atmosphere with a huge explosion. About half of the fragment is destroyed. But the major part survives and hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and an enormous wave is created and spreads. The wall of water rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometres an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned. The wave moves into the Indian Ocean and heads towards Asia.
Millions of people are already dead in the southern part of the Earth, but the north won't escape for long. Tons of broken pieces are thrown into the atmosphere by the explosions. As the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later civilization has collapsed. No more than 10 million people have survived.
Could it really happen? In fact, it has already happened more than once in the history of the Earth. The dinosaurs were on the Earth for over 160 million years. Then 65 million years ago they suddenly disappeared. Many scientists believe that the Earth was hit by a space fragment. The dinosaurs couldn't survive in the cold climate that followed and they became extinct. Will we meet the same end?","{

"More than 700 years ago, Scotland was fighting with England. The King of England wanted to control Scotland. He had a strong army so it was difficult for the Scots to fight. They lost many times. King Robert of Scotland had to run from the English army.
One rainy day, King Robert lay in a cave  . He thought that he was not good enough to be a king. He was so worried that he didn't even see a spider near him. He looked up when he saw the spider climbing. It was trying to climb up to its web at the top of the cave but it fell down.

"Both the young and the old may feel lonely. A three-year-old child will feel lonely when it is left alone, and an old man over eighty years old is often afraid to live alone, too.
Some people feel lonely because they may not have enough time to make friends. Not only the quiet, shy people may feel lonely. Some people are active and outgoing, but they are sometimes afraid to talk and make friends with others. They always try to hold other people away from them. They may seem to have lots of friends, but inside they are hurting.
Are you lonely? If your answer is ""yes"", you may need to work hard enough! Here are some tips to think about:
To be wanted and needed is a big answer to loneliness. Is there any way you can help other people? Try to do something helpful for others even if you are very busy. By helping other people, we find friends and lose loneliness.
Do you have an interest or hobby? Find a group of people with this interest and join them.
Live in the real world! The world on the Internet is not a real world and it is very different from the real life. The students asleep in class are mostly those who often surf the net through the night. As a result, they'll get lost in the real world.
Don't wait for someone to phone, or write, or email you, you call them. And if they seem too busy, it doesn't mean you are not welcome. Try another time!
When you've done anything wrong to other people, don't be too proud to say sorry. You must do that even if you find it hard to open your mouth.","{

"You want to know where the safest place for young children is in the car? For a child of any age, the back seat is the safest place and the safest part of the back seat is the middle. In the back seat, the child is farthest away from the force or effect of head-on collision , which can cause the most injuries. 
       All fifty states of theprefix = st1 /USAhave laws requiring the use of safety seats for young children. If you have children under 8 years of age weighing no more than 80 pounds, it is necessary to fit your car with a special child safety seat.
       The child safety seat comes in three types or sizes: the first type is designed for babies from birth to one year of age, until the baby weighs about 20 pounds; the second size is for children between one and four years of age, who weigh between 20 and 40 pounds; the third kind is used by older children big enough to use the car's belt system. Moreover, all these safety seats must be fitted and held in place on the car's back seat. If your child does need your attention while you are driving, don't look back. Just pull over . 
       In addition, always be sure your child is properly fastened throughout the entire trip. Children who can unfasten their own car seats are subject to fatal injuries in an accident. Start early in your child's life teaching them that car safety is serious business and make sure you give a good example and always wear your own seat belt.","{

"It's what people who don't know each other talk about on elevators. And not about the weather at all. Chatting about the weather with strangers is about emotional comfort (,).
When someone says ""Beautiful day today, isn't it?"" as you settle into that narrow elevator space, or at the bus stop, or waiting in line at the supermarket, the conversation is about feelings. The person is speaking to feel more comfortable with you and offering you a chance to feel more comfortable with him or her.
Being in close proximity with strangers creates interpersonal tension. We can't help it. Tension automatically seeks resolution. What will you do? Do you notice the person now only a short distance away, or pretend not to notice? Avoidance is one strategy: never make eye contact and act as if nobody is there, even when your feelings tell you. In a supermarket checkout line you might leaf through a magazine. On elevators, we often avoid others by looking up at the floor numbers.
The other strategy is to break the tension by noticing the other person. It starts with eye contact. Then we have a choice: smile, nod, make a remark or strike up a conversation. If we choose to talk, the most non-controversial   subject to talk about is the weather. A remark about the weather evokes   agreement and feelings of sympathy. ""What a nice day!"" shares a tiny sliver of happiness. ""I wonder if this rain will ever end."" shares the bad feelings with each other. Both ends of the mini-conversation feel a tiny bit more connected by experiencing this emotion of liking or disliking the weather at the same moment.","{

"""Wake up. Alicia is waiting for you outside,"" my mother called from the kitchen. My mother didn't like me going for this weekend to my friend's house in the mountains. ""I trust you, but I don't trust the people out there,"" she said seriously. ""I'm going to be fine,"" were my last words before closing the door of the Jeep. The vehicle went along the dusty road and my mother grew smaller in the distance.
The trip over the rough road was uncomfortable. It was scary to climb the steep hills surrounded by great pines. After a long trip we finally arrived at the house. From the moment I got there I knew I would forever love the house. It was decorated like an old country home. My room was small, yet set up nicely. That night I went to sleep early, not because I didn't want to continue my search, but because I was tired after the long trip.
In the morning, the singing of the birds woke me up. The light was just getting through the window. A strong smell of baking and fresh coffee came from the kitchen. I wandered around looking for a living soul, but the house was empty. I had the whole day to myself; my friend had gone hiking. I didn't want to go with her. The main reason for this trip was to spend some time alone to think about the events happening in my life.
After an icy shower, my energies were at their fullest. With basket in hand, I started my hunt. I did not mind walking alone; it was a wonderful feeling to be in contact with nature for the first time. The sound of the water running through the rocks gave me great peace.

"Tang Zhou and his wife are planning to have their second child, a test-tube baby. His wife had a natural delivery when she was 34 and their first child, a boy, is now 7. The couple are now hoping to have a daughter through _ in the US. ""My wife couldn't bear another delivery because of her heart condition and her age. Surrogacy helps avoid the risks to older mothers,"" Tang said, ""Moreover, our second child will be born in the US and become a citizen there. That is not a bad choice.""
The couple spent weeks researching their move, looking for a reliable agency that provides surrogacy services overseas. Surrogacy is still illegal in many countries, including China. ""We will be taking much higher risks by relying on a surrogate mother in China because we are not protected by any regulation or law. You pay a lot of money but may meet with many problems,"" Tang said. ""You might not even get your baby back.""
Tang and his wife are part of an increasing number of Chinese couples who are turning to surrogacy services. Tang also considered surrogacy in Thailand but dropped the idea after recent reports about a baby with Down Syndrome  who was delivered through surrogacy and said to have been deserted in Thailand by the biological parents from Australia. Instead, Tang chose the California Surrogacy Center agency as his first option after reading the detailed introduction on its website. Compared with many other agencies that he could contact only via e-mail, the center has a consulting office in Beijing, Tang said.
The center is in San Diego, California, and has satellite offices in Los Angeles and Beijing. According to Liu, the center has been operating for more than eight years, and about 100 surrogate mothers live in California.","{

"Have you ever run into a careless cell phone user on the street? Perhaps they were busy talking, testing or checking updates on WeChat without looking at what was going on around them. As the number of this new ""species"" of human has kept rising, they have been given a new name -- phubbers  .
Recently, a cartoon created by students from China Central Academy of Fine Arts put this group of people under the spotlight. In the short film, phubbers with various social identities bury themselves in their phones. A doctor plays with his cell phone while letting his patient die, a pretty woman takes selfie in front of a car accident siteand a father loses his child without knowing about it while using his mobile phone. A chain of similar events eventually leads to the destruction of the world.
Although the ending sounds overstated, the damage phubbing can bring is real. Your health is the first to bear the effect and result of it. ""Constantly bending your head to check your cell phone could damage your neck,"" Guangming Daily quoted doctors as saying. ""The neck is like a rope that breaks after long-term stretching."" Also, staring at cell phones for long periods of time will damage your eyesight gradually, according to the report.
But that's not all. Being a phubber could also damage your social skills and drive you away from your friends and family. At reunions with family or friends, many people tend to stick to their cell phones while others are chatting happily with each other and this creates a strange atmosphere, Qilu Evening News reported.
It can also cost you your life. There have been lots of reports on phubbers who fell to their death, suffered accidents, and were robbed of their cell phones in broad daylight.","{

"Eddie's father used to say he'd spent so many years by the ocean, breathing seawater. Now, away from that ocean, in the hospital bed, his body began to look like a beached fish. His condition went from fair to stable and from stable to serious. Friends went from saying, ""He'll be home in a day"" to ""He'll be home in a week."" In his father's absence, Eddie helped out at the pier  , working evenings after his taxi job.
              When Eddie was a teenager, if he ever complained or seemed bored with the pier, his father would shout, ""What? This isn't good enough for you?"" And later, when he'd suggested Eddie take a job there after high school, Eddie almost laughed, and his father again said, ""What? This isn't good enough for you?"" And before Eddie went to war, when he'd talked of marrying Marguerite and becoming an engineer, his father said, ""What? This isn't good enough for you?""
              And now, regardless of all that, here he was, at the pier, doing his father's labor.
              Parents rarely let go of their children, so children let go of them. They move on. They move away. It is not until much later, as the heart weakens, that children understand; their stories, and all their accomplishments, sit on top of the stories of their mothers and fathers, stones upon stones, beneath the waters of their lives.
              Finally, one night, at his mother's urging, Eddie visited the hospital. He entered the room slowly. His father, who for years had refused to speak to Eddie, now lacked the strength to even try.
              ""Don't sweat it, kid,"" the other workers told him. ""Your old man will pull through. He's the toughest man we've ever seen.""

"The use of the word imitation  reminds me that we ought to make some more comments on the risk of people imitating what they see on the screen in the way of crime  or violence. First there was always a risk of children acting out scenes which could be dangerous. For example, I remember a woman who was head of a middle school telling me that she had happened to look out of her window when the children were on the playground and had seen them putting a small boy on a chair with a rope round his neck and the rope over the branch of a tree; fortunately she was in time to get there before the child was hanged. I remember a film in particular in which the hero who was imprisoned had escaped by electrocuting  his guard, the technique of doing this being shown in detail. This was the kind of scene which we could cut for these reasons.
In films for young people and adults we always tried to keep off the screen the details of criminal techniques, such as how to open a locked door with a piece of hard plastic or how to open a safe; if we were consulted  before production, I used to advise that the details should not be shown. When I gave talks in prisons about film checking I had full support for this, since fathers who were in prison for criminal offences did not want their children to get on crime.
Every time I gave a talk in a prison someone used to mention the French film Rififi. made by Jules Dassin in 1954. This remarkable film showed in great detail a robbery of a jeweler's shop, the robbery lasting about half an hour and being backed by only natural sound...one of the most brilliant film sequences  of all time. I remember our discussion at the time. We thought that the robbery was finished only with the use of advanced and obviously expensive equipment and that only the most experienced and skilled criminals could possibly imitate it; we believed therefore that it was  ly safe. When talking in prisons some years later I learned that there had been several robberies in which the techniques had been copied, so perhaps we were wrong.","{

"The cold wind cut through my enthusiasm as a tourist in Washington D.C., so I entered the nearest restaurant for warmth. I ordered a hot cup of coffee, and began observing people. 
  Some people were having dinner in the great hall, which made me consider an early dinner. At that time, I observed a man seated nearby and, from his eager eyes, I realized that he noticed the delicious food. His tired body and worn clothes shouted, ""Homeless, homeless!""
     I wondered how long it had been since he had eaten. I expected him to approach me for a handout  . He never did. A silent war broke out in my head --one side was telling me to mind my own business, and the other was urging me to offer him the food.

"Imagine sailing through the sky, high above buildings and trees, in perfect peace and quiet. No noisy engines. No window with dirty marks in your way. No strong wind blowing in your face. You can't feel or hear the wind because you're traveling in the exact same direction and at the exact same speed it is.
A hot-air balloon has three main parts: the balloon, called an envelope; a basket, where passengers ride; and a burner system, which supplies the hot air.
Most balloon envelopes are made of strong, lightweight nylon.  They vary in size and shape, but they have to be really, really big to lift even a single person. Most weigh more than an adult man and use more fabric than you'd need to cover a baseball diamond .
The basket is usually made of wicker ,which is strong but not too stiff . It needs to bend a bit for a soft landing, just like a good jumper bends her legs instead of keeping them stiff and straight when she lands.
When the burner system blasts  flames, it makes a noisy sound, but once the balloon is flying , the burner can be turned off. The air in the envelope will then slowly cool, and the balloon will gradually sink unless the pilot starts the burner again.
To operate, a pilot adds hot air to the balloon to go up or deflates it to go down, until he finds a breeze blowing in the direction he wants to fly. But no matter which way the wind blows them, balloonists have an amazing bird's-eye view of the world.","{

The Heihachi Tea House, in the northern part of Kyoto, is one of the city's oldest business establishments. It is said to have opened in 1576. The present owner, Sonobe Heihachi, who is also the chef, represents the 20th generation of the Sonobe family to oversee the tea house.
Sonobe Heihachi, restaurant owner, said, ""During the middle of the Edo era, from 1603 to 1868, it became customary for commoners to dine in mat rooms. The Heihachi Tea House specialized in a dish comprised of rice with barley . It then became an inn and a little later, a restaurant.""
Like every other chef, Sonobe Heihachi's day often begins at the market where he personally selects ingredients that will be served to his customers. The restaurant specializes in a style of cuisine known as Kaiseki Ryori--possibly the ultimate in Japanese cooking. It offers both fresh and ocean fishes on its menu, including bream and eels. The owner's son Sonobe Shingo is also an accomplished chef. His skills include the elaborate cutting of a ""daikon"" radish   into strips. Later they will be shredded into thin strands to form part of the garnish  for sashimi.
Sonobe Shingo admits that when it comes to the small details of running the business, father and son have different ways of thinking. Sometimes they clash.
But they share a passion for what they do and continue to preserve an innovative and deeply rooted culinary  tradition.","{

"Do you know how it is when you see someone yawn and you start yawning too? Or how hard it is to be among people laughing and not laugh yourself? Well, apparently it's because we have mirror neurons  in our brains.
Put simply, the existence of mirror neurons suggests that every time we see someone else do something, our brains imitate  it,whether or not we actually perform the same action. This explains a great deal about how we learn to smile, talk, walk, dance or play sports. But the idea goes further: mirror neurons not only appear to explain physical actions
they also tell us that there is a biological basis for the way we understand other people.
Mirror neurons can undoubtedly be found all over our brains, but especially in the areas which relate to our ability to use languages, and to understand how other people feel. Researchers have found that mirror neurons relate strongly to language. A group of researchers discovered that if they gave people sentences to listen to (for example: ""The hand took hold of the ball""), the same mirror neurons were
as when the action was actually performed (in this example, actually taking hold of a ball).
Any problems with mirror neurons may well result in problems with behavior. Much research suggests that people with social and behavioral problems have mirror neurons which are not fully functioning. However, it is not yet known exactly how these discoveries might help find treatments for social disorders.
Research into mirror neurons seems to provide us with ever more information concerning how humans behave and interact .Indeed, it may turn out to be the equivalent  for neuroscience of what Einstein's theory of relativity was for physics. And the next time you feel the urge to cough in the cinema when someone else does---well, perhaps you'll understand why.","{

"Whether you're up for a Crocodile Dundee adventure or you'd just like a taste of the Australian sun, the beaches in and around Sydney can offer you all that and more.
Sydney Beach
Sydney Beach is located at Sydney's northernmost tip on an extension  of land ending at Palm Beach. Before checking out the golden sand, take a quick tour of the houses of millionaires from the art and film industries.
Palm Beach
Only about an hour from downtown Sydney, Palm Beach offers a long stretch  of clean sand and water. With parking near the center of the beach, that leaves the rest of it as a _ population and peaceful location from which you can surf or body board--but take care; without the huge crowds of other Sydney beaches, Palm Beach doesn't afford quite the safety level to be found elsewhere; volunteer lifesavers are on duty only on weekends and holidays.
Bondi Beach
For the big name beach, Bondi Beach has to be your choice. Parking is difficult to find even on slow days, so consider taking public transport to this world-known beach in the eastern Sydney suburbs. Easily reachable by taxi, bus, and rail, Bondi Beach offers sun bathing, swimming, snorkeling, and all sorts of water sports fun. If you're in the mood for a bit of exercise, two scenic coastal walks will afford you great views and sights along the shore. Take in views from Mackenzie's Point. It starts at Bondi and heads south to Bronte Beach. But don't try to swim in Mackenzie's Bay--it holds dangers such as hidden rocks.
Bronte Beach
Your second choice for a scenic coastal walk covers a little under two miles and takes you from Bronte Beach to Waverly Cemetery, where many famous Australians are buried, including poets Henry Kendall, Doreothea Mackellar, and Henry Lawson.","{

"What does it mean to cry over a book? ""I'm a reader who did not weep,"" Ruth Graham, a well-known critic, wrote. ""Does this make me heartless? Or does it make me a grown-up?""
Tears have played a surprisingly important part in the history of the novel. Readers have always asked about the role that emotion plays in reading: What does it mean to be deeply moved by a book? Which books are worthy objects of our feelings?
In different times, people answered those questions in different ways. In the early eighteenth century, when the novel was still a new form, crying was a sign of readers' virtue. ""Sentimental"" novels, full of touching scenes, gave readers an occasion to exercise their ""finer feelings."" Your tear proved that you were likely to feel the suffering of others.
At that time, sentimental novels were hugely popular, but also easy to attack. Tears, after all, had no necessary connection to actual virtue, and they could be not true  As the critic John Mullan points out, by the end of the eighteenth century, the word ""sentimental"" had acquired a new meaning -- ""addicted to low emotion"" -- bringing it closer to the meaning that it has for us today.
In the nineteenth century, the meaning of tears evolved in two different directions. Some writers sought to waken ""higher"" feelings in their readers: Victorian sentimentalists wrote touching scenes in an effort to inspire social and political reform. However, the ""sensation"" novel, a different type of Victorian best-seller, showed that tears could be enjoyable in themselves. Sensation novels were the leaders of the modern thriller and mystery. Heavy on secrets, and madness, they were known for creating physical ""sensations"" in their readers -- trembling, a fast beating heart, and tears. But these were tears without moral purpose or effect.
Today's debate about crying while reading looks back on all of this history. The debate, in fact, is about why books matter to us, and what reading is ""for."" Talking about what makes us cry is a way of talking about ourselves.","{

"Tourism probably started in Roman times. Rich Romans visited friends and family who were working in another part of the Roman Empire. But when the empire broke down,this kind of tourism stopped.
In the early 17th century, the idea of the ""Grand Tour"" was born. Rich young English people sailed across the English Channel .They visited the most beautiful and important European cities of the time, including Paris in France, and Rome and Venice in Italy. Their tours lasted for two to four years, and the tourists stayed a few weeks or months in each city. The ""Grand Tour"" was an important part of young people's education--but only for the rich.
In the 18th century, tourism began to change. For example, people in the UK started to visit some towns, such as Bath to"" take the waters"". They believed that the water there was good for their health. So large and expensive hotels were built in these towns.
In the 19th century, travel became much more popular and faster. When the first railways were built in the 1820s, it was easier for people to travel between towns, so they started to go for holidays by the sea. And some started to have holidays in the countryside as cities became larger, noisier and dirtier.
Traveling by sea also became faster and safer when the first steamships were built. People began to travel more to far away countries.
The 20th century saw cars become more and more popular among ordinary people. Planes were made larger, so ticket prices dropped and more people used them.
Thus tourism grew. In 1949, Russian journalist Vladimir Raitz started a company called Horizon Holidays. The company organizes everything--plane tickets, hotel rooms, even food--and tourists pay for it all before they leave home. The package tour and modern tourist industry was born.
The first travel agency in China was set up as early as 1949.But tourism did not take off until 1978.In 2002,the industry was worth 500 billion yuan and became an important part of China's social development.","{

"V. Stiviano says Donald Sterling's racist comments on an audio recording leaked to the public were not the first by the Los Angeles Clippers owner in conversations with her.
""There's been a number of occasions where Mr. Sterling and I had conversations just like this one. This was one of very many,"" Stiviano told Barbara Walters on ABC's ""20/20"" in an interview that aired Friday night. ""Part of what the world heard was only 15 minutes. There's a number of other hours that the world doesn't know.""
Sterling, who has been banned for life by the NBA for the remarks, also spoke for the first time since the scandal. ""I wish I had just paid her off,"" Sterling told DuJour.com, referring to Stiviano. According to the person who conducted the interview, Sterling ""expressed remorse.""
Sterling told Stiviano in the recording that she should not post online photos of herself with black people, including basketball great Magic Johnson, or bring black people to Clippers' games.
The recording, which an attorney for Stiviano said was leaked by a third party, led to public outcry across the country and the NBA. Some sponsors dropped the Clippers and others re-evaluated their relationship with the NBA.
On Tuesday, NBA Commissioner Adam Silver banned Sterling for life, fined him $2.5 million, and urged league owners to force him to sell the team. A three-quarters vote by the NBA owners is required to force him to sell.
Though Stiviano told Walters that Sterling should "" ly"" apologize, she said she still loves him like a father figure and does not believe he is a racist.
""I think Mr. Sterling is from a different generation than I am,"" she said. ""I think he was brought up to believe these things . . . segregation, whites and blacks. But through his actions he's shown that he's not a racist. He's shown to be a very generous and kind man.""
Stiviano said that since the ban, Sterling has felt confused, alone, and not supported by those around him.
""I think he's highly more traumatized and hurt by the things that he said himself,"" she said. ""I think he can't even believe or understand sometimes the thing he says, and I think he's hurt by it. He's hurting right now.""
A real-estate mogul, Sterling has been accused of racial missteps before.
The billionaire had paid a $2.76 million settlement to resolve a federal lawsuit accusing him of systematically excluding blacks and Hispanics from his rental properties. He also won a wrongful termination lawsuit by general manager Elgin Baylor, who accused him of various slurs and slights.","{

"Many people say dolphins are very intelligent. They seem to be able to think, understand, and learn things quickly. But are they smart like humans or more than cats or dogs? Dolphins use their brains differently from people. But scientists say dolphin intelligence and human intelligence are similar in some ways. How?
Fact 1: Talk to me
Like humans, every dolphin has its own ""name"". The name is a special whistle. Each dolphin chooses a specific whistle for itself, usually by its first birthday. Actually, scientists think dolphins, like people, ""talk"" to each other about a lot of things, such as their age, their feelings, or finding food. And, like humans, dolphins use a system of sounds and body language to communicate. But understanding their conversations is not easy for humans. No one speaks ""dolphin"" yet, but some scientists are trying to learn.
Fact 2: Let's play
Dolphins are also social animals. They live in groups, and they often join others from different groups to play games and have fun--just like people. In fact, playing together is something only intelligent animals do.
Fact 3: Fishermen's helper
Dolphins and humans are similar in another way: both make plans to get something they want. In the seas of southern Brazil, for example, dolphins use an interesting strategy to get food. When fish are near a boat, dolphins show signs to the fishermen to put their nets in the water. Using this method, the men can catch a lot of fish. What is the advantage for the dolphins in doing so? They get to eat some of the fish.","{

"In 1886 explorer Robert Peary traveled to Greenland for the U.S. Navy. Before his journey, no one knew Greenland's size or shape. On Peary's first trips, he explored Greenland, mapping parts of it.
When Peary returned to the United States, he went to a businessman to sell some furs. There he met Matthew Henson, an African American mechanic, builder and navigator. When Peary went to Nicaragua on a Navy mission ,Henson went with him. When that job was over, the two headed to the Arctic.
Henson and Peary set sail for Greenland. When they landed, Henson built a house for their base camp. Peary and his men set out to explore the land by dog sledge . Henson was injured and had to stay at the base. While there, he made friends with the Inuit, the native people.
In 1895 Henson, Peary and Hugh Lee went out on another dog sledge journey. This time, they found Greenland's northernmost point. They now knew that the North Pole lay under the frozen Arctic Ocean. Peary had hoped to cross the ice. but the group ran out of food and returned to base camp. In the years that followed, Peary and Henson tried several times to reach the North Pole, but each time they failed. On one trip, Peary's feet froze, and he lost his toes .
Peary and Henson planned last trip when Peary was 53 years old. They started across the sea ice from Ellesmere Island, which is located  north of Canada. The temperature dropped as low as--51 degrees Celsius. The explores' cheeks froze , and they suffered snow blindness from the sun's glare. They experienced high winds and storms, and they also faced a hidden danger. Under the frozen ocean were powerful currents . The ice moved and broke apart leaving open water, called leads.

"Failure is probably the most exhausting experience a person ever has. There is nothing more tiring than not succeeding.
We experience this tiredness in two ways: as start-up fatigue  and performance fatigue. In the former case, we keep putting off a task because it has either too boring or too difficult. And the longer we delay it, the more tired we feel.
Such start-up fatigue is very real, even if not actually physical, not something in our muscles and bones. The solution is obvious though perhaps not easy to apply: always handle the most difficult job first.
Years ago, I was asked to write 102 essays on the great ideas of some famous authors. Applying my own rule, I determined to write them in alphabetical , never letting myself leave out a tough idea. And I always started the day's work with the difficult task of essay-writing. Experience proved that the rule works.
Performance fatigue is more difficult to handle. Though willing to get started, we cannot seem to do the job right. Its difficulties appear so great that, however hard we work, we fail again and again. In such a situation, I work as hard as I can-then let the unconscious take over.
When planning Encyclopaedia Britannica (<<>> ), I had to create a table of contents based on the topics of its articles. Nothing like this had ever been done before, and day after dat I kept coming up with solutions, but none of them worked. My fatigue became almost unbearable.
One day, mentally exhausted, I wrote down all the reasons why this problem could not be solved. I tried to convince myself that the trouble was with the problem itself, not with me. Relived, I sat back in an easy chair and fell asleep.
An hour later, I woke up suddenly with the solution clearly in mind. In the weeks that followed, the solution which had come up in my unconscious mind provided correct at every step. Though I worked as hard as before, I felt no fatigue. Success was now as exciting as failure had been depressing.
Human beings, I believe must try to succeed. Success, then, means never feeling tired.","{

"Tired of telling students to ask questions and to think about what they were doing, Damien Hynes, a high school geography teacher in Australia, decided to do an experiment to test what he had long been thinking.He wrote some well-organized nonsense (something untrue) on the blackboard.The students simply copied it but very few asked any questions.This shows that students are willing to believe anything given by teachers.The story is repeated in support of the Project for Enhancing Effective Learning (PEEL).
PEEL was carried out by some teachers and researchers in Melbourne who had concluded that normal teaching methods seldom achieve their intended goals; what the teachers think they are teaching is one thing and what the students actually learn is something else.Students' lack of an over-all view of learning goals and their concentration on test scores make them see each lesson as a separate activity.
Researchers realized that many students do not come into class empty-headed but have their own explanations of how the world works.Their own ideas can remain important to them even when they differ from scientific explanations that are learned later.In fact such ideas are hardly affected by traditional teaching.Students accept the teacher's scientific explanation, but do not drop their own.They simply keep both and use them practically: in a class test, they copy the teacher's idea, but in real life they use their own.
Clearly what was needed was to make students understand their learning process , and this is what the PEEL teachers set out to deal with.On the surface,  a class being taught by PEEL methods only differs from an ordinary class in being a little noisier, because more people are talking.But there are some meaningful changes.Students are given much more time to express their views, and teachers don't make immediate judgment.The students are allowed to guide what is done in class and their own ideas are always respected.This draws their attention to the actual learning process, and they become responsible for their own progress.","{

"In 1995,I returned to Miami Beach High School to speak to the drama   class.Afterward I asked the drama teacher if any of my English teachers was still there.""Irene Roberts,""he told me,""is in class just down the hall.""
I was no one special in Miss Roberts' class.I don't remember any one special bit of wisdom she passed on.Yet I cannot forget her respect for language,for ideas and for her students.I realize now,many years later,that she is a selfless teacher.I'd like to say something to her,but I don't want to pull her from a class.
The drama teacher brought Miss Roberts into the hallway where stood this 32yearold man she last saw at 18.""I'm Mark Medoff,""I told her.""You were my 12th grade English teacher in 1981.""She raised her head,as if this angle   might bring back her memory.And then,though armed with a message I wanted to deliver in some perfect words,I couldn't think up anything more memorable than this,""I want you to know,""I said,""you were important to me.""
And there in the hallway,this slight and lovely woman,now nearing retirement age,this teacher who didn't remember me,began to weep;she held me in her arms.
Remembering this moment,I began to sense that everything I will ever know,everything I will ever pass on to my students,to my children,is an inseparable part of a treasure of our shared wonder and hope that we can,must,make ourselves better.
Irene Roberts held me in her arms and through her tears whispered against my cheek,""Thank you.""And then,with a quick look into my forgotten face,she disappeared back into her classroom,returned to what she had done thousands of days through all the years of my absence.
On reflection,maybe those were,after all,just the right words to say to Irene Roberts.Maybe they are the very words I would like to speak to all those teachers I carry through my life as part of me,the very words I would like spoken to me one day by some returning student,""I want you to know you were important to me.""","{

This belief had existed for a long time until scientists started asking a new question: What do fathers contribute to their children besides their genes? They must mean something, or they would have disappeared from children's lives at an earlier time in evolution . So, a new science of fatherhood was born.
American journalist Paul Raeburn collected the discoveries over the years and put them into his new book, Do Fathers Matter? What Science Is Telling Us About the Parent We've Overlooked, hoping to make people better see the many ways that fathers influence their children.
For example, Ronald Preston Rohner, a scientist at the University of Connecticut, US, spent several years studying how being accepted or rejected by parents influences children's personality. He found that children who are accepted by both their parents are usually independent and hold a positive worldview while those who feel turned down by either parent may turn out hostile and negative.
Melanie Horn-Mallers, a psychologist at California State University, found that sons who have happy memories of their fathers are better able to handle day-to-day stress after growing up.
Another study, by Richard Koestner at McGill University, Canada, focused on how children develop empathy . After looking at various possible factors, Koestner found one to be more important than others -- how much time their fathers spend with them.
""We were amazed to find that how affectionate parents were with their children didn't matter much to the development of empathy,"" said Koestner. ""And we were astounded at how strong the father's influence was.""
Indeed, evidence shows that fathers make unique contributions to their children's happiness. However, that doesn't mean that children in families without fathers are definitely going to become failures. Just look at US President Barack Obama. He is a great example of what can be achieved by people who grow up in single-mother households.","{

"Helen Thomas, the pioneering White House reporter known for putting presidents on the hot seat, died at 92.
To those who regularly watch presidential press conferences, Helen Thomas is a familiar figure.Usually dressed in red and always seated in the front row, she is always the first or second reporter the president calls upon.It is an honor she has earned.Besides, it affords her the perfect opportunity to do what she does best - challenge the president and other public officials to tell the plain truth.She said, ""We reporters' priority  is the people's right to know - without fear or favor.We are the people's servants.""
Helen Thomas was born in Kentucky in 1920.All the nine Thomas children were brought up to value education, and all were expected to make something of themselves through working hard.She made up her mind while still in high school to become a reporter after writing for the student newspaper.After receiving her bachelor's degree in 1942, Thomas headed straight for Washington, D.C.in search of a newspaper job.Before long, she landed one at Washington Daily News.Her duty included fetching coffee and doughnuts for the paper's reporters and editors.The eager young woman found the atmosphere exciting and was convinced she had made the right career choice.
Her big break came when she was sent to Florida to report on the vacation of President-elect John F.Kennedy and his family.Once President Kennedy took office, Thomas changed her focus from the president's family to his policies.She began attending the daily press briefings at the White House as well as presidential press conferences.Thomas has covered every president since Kennedy.Over the years, Thomas found her job ""thrilling and inspiring,"" but never boring.And she took very seriously her duty to ""keep an eye on the president"" and keep American people informed.","{

"Benjamin Franklin was born in 1706 and died in 1790.The philosopher and writer was one of the most important men in the early days of the United States. He believed strongly in the importance of hard work, and he himself worked hard all his life, from the time he left school at the age of ten.
""Poor Richard,"" a character Franklin created, summarized Franklin's ideas in short sayings . Many of Poor Richard's sayings are still remembered today. One of the most famous is ""Early to bed, and early to rise, makes a man healthy, wealthy and wise,"" from the essay ""The Way of Wealth.""
In the same essay , Franklin talks about the danger of laziness and the value of ambitiousness .He asks what is accomplished by ""wishing and hoping for better times"". He says that we can make these times better if we try hard enough. People who spend all their time just hoping will die without food. They shouldn't expect everything to be easy, or as Poor Richard says, ""there are no gains without pains."" Franklin also says that we should work today, not wait until tomorrow.

"Hello, children and parents. Thank you all for coming to this meeting. I'd like to start by confirming that we will receive some money from the government for our school trip to Indonesia. 
We will receive approximately $1,300 per child, which will reduce the overall cost to you.
Now that we are sure to get the money, it is time to do some serious planning. We are sure that the trip will be very exciting for the children, especially if they have not traveled overseas before. There are many benefits to having some exposure to different places and cultures. Your children will be able to learn a lot about other people and cultures on this trip.
Leanne is with us tonight. Leanne, where are you? Put up your hand, Leanne, so that the people can see who you are. Thank you. Leanne went on the trip last year and will be happy to tell you .of her experiences and answer any questions you might have. We will hear from her a bit later in the meeting.

"Moving to a new neighborhood,town,state,or even country can be a pretty scary experience. All you know is that things will be different and chances are you won't know the kids at your new school.
The experiences that go with moving make many kids feel nervous and worried. This is perfectly normal but don't let these emotions overrun your thoughts! You will soon get used to your surroundings and find new friends at your new school.
Leaving old friends and familiar places behind can be difficult. However,as you begin the moving process,keep in mind that saying goodbye to your old house,school,and friends does not mean that you have to forget them or that your farewell is permanent!If you're moving to a new state or even a different country and won't see your friends for a long time,don't despair.
Make sure to ask everyone for their address so you can write them letters. Also,thanks to the Internet,it is very easy to stay in touch through email or instant messaging technologies. With your parent's permission,you can even create a blog or web page to chronicle  all of your new experiences. Include your thoughts,tales of your new adventures,even pictures of new friends,your new house,and new town. Your old friends will love seeing what you are busy with.
Many schools have an orientation  program where a student already established at the school shows a new student around for their first week. This can help you to find your way around the school and to make new friends faster.
While moving is tough on kids of any age,high school counselor Karen Turner says moves can be particularly difficult for teens .""I think moving during adolescents is an extremely stressful experience,especially if you are into your junior high or senior year. Students tend to have established a very strong peer network during that period in their lives. Often this has more influence on them even than their families in some cases,and when they are torn from that there's often resentment .""However,Turner adds that while moving isn't easy,there are things that your parents and the school can do to help you deal with the change.","{

"Lying in the sun on a rock, the cougar saw Jeb and his son, Tom, before they saw it. Jeb put his bag down quickly and pulled his jacket open with both hands, making himself look big to the cougar. It worked. The cougar hesitated, ready to attack Jeb, but ready to forget the whole thing, too.
Jeb let go of his jacket, grasped Tom and held him across his body, making a cross. Now the cougar's enemy looked even bigger, and it rose up, ready to move away, but unfortunately Tom got scared and struggled free of Jeb.
""Tom, no!"" shouted his father.
But Tom broke and ran and that's the last thing you do with a cougar. The second Tom broke free, Jeb threw himself on the cougar, just as it jumped from the rock. They hit each other in mid-air and both fell. The cougar was on Jeb in a flash, forgetting about Tom, which was what Jeb wanted.
Cougars are not as big as most people think and a determined man stands a chance, even with just his fists. As the cougar's claws got into his left shoulder, Jeb swung his fist at its eyes and hit hard. The animal howled and put its head back. Jeb followed up with his other fist. Then out of the corner of his eye, Jeb saw Tom. The boy was running back to help his father.
""Knife, Tom"" shouted Jeb.
The boy ran to his father's bag, while Jeb stated shouting as well as hitting, to keep the cougar's attention away from Tom. Tom got the knife and ran over to Jeb. The cougar was moving its head in and out, trying to find a way through the wall Jeb was making out of his arms. Tom swung with the knife, into the cougar's back. It howled horribly and ran off into the mountains.

"It was a late Wednesday night when the dreading phone call reached our home. I sat up, somehow terrified, so I could hear the phone call better. To my surprise, I heard my mom burst into tears. ""Get the car, Dean! Andrea has been in a car accident.""
 _ We got to the hospital, but were not allowed to see Andrea. The next morning, after wearing masks, we were allowed to go to the ICU to see Andrea. Well, the least I could say was that everything was injured in her body and she lost all of her memories. It was a fatal accident.
Over the next two months, I lived more at the hospital than I did at my house. I watched as Andrea worked so hard to gain back everyday motor skills. She never once complained or pitied herself; her determined spirit was shining through. After two weeks in the ICU and two months of the regular hospital treatment, Andrea was able to come home. She missed several months of school, so it was hard for her to catch up. Andrea had tasks to accomplish, and no matter how hard it was, she stuck with them until the job was done. Though busy with dealing with pain and therapy, she always found time to love and play with me.

"To be able to motivate oneself, or self-motivate, occurs when a person has the willingness to do something and is internally  motivated to do it.
Sometimes it's very difficult to get ourselves moving.The natural tendency is to postpone.Life just seems to get in the way! There is a job to go to, groceries to do, television to watch--whoops! I guess we get pretty good at finding excuses to escape getting started on goals like an exercise routine or reading a new book.The fact is that we are creatures of routine and habit.So what can we do to motivate ourselves to accomplish our goals?
Here are some tips on how to get moving:
Decide what you want.It's hard to motivate an aimless mind.Set a goal and decide how you are going to go about it.Then break it down into smaller sections so it's easier to handle and less overwhelming. 
Keep track of your progress.Keep a log or journal where you can measure how much you have accomplished.Looking at it can also motivate you to keep pushing ahead.
Post motivating pictures or slogans within your sight.It is always inspiring to see pictures of people who have accomplished what you're going for.It makes it attainable and realistic.Likewise, little slogans like ""go for it"" or ""just do it"" can give you the little support you need.
 _ .If you remind yourself to go for the desired promotion, it will re-establish why you are doing what you're doing.

On the shows, the five fathers and their children traveled around China, riding camels through the western deserts, fishing on the east coast, and selling vegetables for their bus fare  home in southwestern Yunnan Province.
One dad doesn't know how to do his daughter's hair, so some people try to help him. Another one must _ with his son for three days in the desert. Because the father can't cook, they only eat instant noodles .
Why is Where Are We Going, Dad? so popular? Because it is about how Chinese parents look after their kids. The show makes modern parents think about what they should do with their kids.

"Trapped on the 37thFloor
Melinda Skaar wasn't expecting any phone calls. Skaar was working late in her office at the First Internet bank of California. By 10:45 that night she was almost ready to go home when the phone rang.
Picking it up, she heard a guard shouting. There is a fire! Get out of there.
Skaar didn't panic. She figured that it was just a small fire. Her office building was huge. There were 62 floors and her desk was on the 37thfloor.
Skaar called out to office mate Stephen Oksas, who also stayed late to work. But when they got out to the hallway, they were met by a cloud of black smoke. Rushing back, Skaar shut the door and filled the space at the bottom of the door with her jacket to keep the smoke out.
Then they called 911. before they could call their families, however, the line went dead. That meant that they were completely cut off from the outside world. All they could do was wait and hope someone would come to rescue them.
Minutes ticked by. Smoke began to float into the office. Soon it became hard for them to breathe.
Looking around, Skaar noticed a small workroom. It seemed to have cleaner air. So they crowed there. That helped for a while, but in time even the workroom was filled with deadly smoke.

"2010 was the year the Earth struck back.
Earthquakes, heat waves, floods, volcanoes, super typhoons, blizzards  , landslides and droughts killed at least a quarter million people in 2010 - the deadliest year in more than a generation. More people were killed worldwide by natural disasters this year than have been killed in terrorism attacks in the past 40 years combined.
""It just seemed like it was back-to-back  and it came in waves,"" said Craig Fugate, who heads the US Federal Emergency Management Agency. It handled a record number of disasters in 2010.
""The term ""100-year event' really lost its meaning this year.""
And we have ourselves to blame most of the time, scientists and disaster experts say.
Even though many disasters have the ring of random chance, the hand of man made this a particularly deadly, costly, extreme and strange year for everything from wild weather to earthquakes.
Poor construction and development practices make earthquakes more deadly than they need be. More people live in poverty in vulnerable buildings  in crowded cities. That means that when the ground shakes, the river floods, or the tropical cyclone hits, more people die.
Disasters from the Earth, such as earthquakes and volcanoes ""are pretty much constant,"" said Andreas Schraft, vice president of catastrophic perils for the Geneva-based insurance giant Swiss Re. ""All the change that's made is man-made.""
The January earthquake that killed well more than 220,000 people in Haiti is a perfect example. Port-au-Prince has nearly three times as many people - many of them living in poverty- and more poorly built shanties  ,than it did 25 years ago. So had the same quake hit in 1985 instead of 2010; total deaths would have probably been in the 80,000 range, said Richard Olson, director of disaster risk reduction at Florida International University.
Climate scientists say Earth's climate also is changing thanks to man-made global warming, bringing extreme weather, such as heat waves and flooding.
The excessive  amount of extreme weather that dominated 2010 is a classic sign of man-made global warming that climate scientists have long warned about. They calculate that the killer Russian heat wave - setting a national record of 111 degrees - would happen once every 100,000 years without global warming.
Data show that 18 countries broke their records for the hottest day ever.

"FOR many young people, having to attend school with a parent would be their worst nightmare. However, Senior 1 student Li Qinmei is happy taking her father with her as long as she can go to classes. He is disabled and unable to take care of himself.
The 16-year-old country girl in Zhucheng, Shandong Province has experienced one disaster after another in her short life. Li lost her mother at three. Four years later, her father became paralyzed after a tractor accident. At 12, her misfortune returned with the death of her grandma. Since then she has been forced to shoulder all the responsibility for her broken family.
Li learnt to cook and managed to live a life with an allowance of only 24 yuan per month. The most difficult thing she had to deal with was helping her father bathe, dress and use the toilet as he could hardly move.
""I felt embarrassed, and so did my dad. It was really hard at the beginning,"" she recalled.
During most of her junior school years, Li went to classes only once a month as her father was seriously ill at the time.
""I taught myself at home and asked teachers for help on my school days,"" she explained.
Li's hard work paid off this fall. She was admitted by Zhucheng No 1 High School, a local key school, based on her good performance in the entrance exams.
The school offered Li and her father a room on campus to live in so she could look after him during breaks.
Once in a while, Li felt sad when she saw her classmates going shopping or _ with friends.
""I envy them sometimes because they have both mum and dad to look after them. However, I soon feel relieved as I still have my dad with me,"" she said.
Li admitted that the difficulties in life had taught her to be strong.
""I believe I will go on and continue my studies at a good university,"" she said, in a confident tone.
Her teacher Mr. Wang has the same belief. Li made great progress in the recent monthly exams. ""She works hard and is always eager to excel  . It's not easy for her never to be late for school, but she has managed to make it work,"" Wang said.","{

"Young people and older people don't always agree. They sometimes have different ideas about living, working and playing. But in one special programme in New York State, adults and teenagers live together in a friendly way.
Each summer 200 teenagers and 50 adults live together for eight weeks as members of a special work group. Everyone works several hours each day. They do so not just to keep busy but to find meaning and enjoyment in work. Some teenagers work in the woods or on the farms near the village. Some learn to make things like tables and chairs and build houses. The adults teach them these skills.
There are several free hours each day. Weekends are free, too. During the free hours some of the teenagers learn photo taking or painting. Others sit around and talk or sing. Each teenager chooses his own way to spend his free time.
When people live together, rules are necessary. In this programme the teenagers and the adults make the rules together. If someone breaks a rule, the problem goes before the whole group. They talk about it and ask, ""Why did it happen? What should we do about it?""

"Last year, two days after Christmas, we kicked China out of the house. Not the country obviously, but bits of plastic, metal, and wood with the words ""Made in China"". We kept what we already had, but stopped bringing any more in. because it had coated our lives with toys, and useless stuff. Sometimes I worried about jobs sent overseas, but price triumphed over virtue at our house. We couldn't resist what China was selling.
But on that dark Monday last year, an unease feeling washed over me as I sat on the sofa. It wasn't until then that I noticed a fact: China was taking over the place.
It stared back at me from the empty screen of the television. I spied it in the pile of tennis shoes by the door. It glowed in the lights on the Christmas tree and watched me in the eyes of a doll lying on the floor, I slipped off the couch and sorted gifts into two piles: China and non-China. The count came to China, 25, the world, 14. Christmas, I realized, had become a holiday made by the Chinese. Suddenly I wanted China out.
I persuaded my husband, and on Jan. 1 st, we started a-year-long household embargo on Chinese imports. The idea wasn't to punish China. And we didn't fool ourselves into thinking because we wanted to measure how far it had pushed in. We wanted to know what it would take in time, money, and worry to kick our China habit!

""When we can buy China things again? Let's never stop."" My son said.

"The Attack on September 11th
New York: When the first jet struck Tower 1 at World Trade Center at 8: 48 am on Tuesday, the people in Tower 2 at World Trade Center with a view of the instant damage across the divide had the clearest sense of what they too must do : get out fast.
Katherine Ilachinski, who had been knocked off her chair by the blast of heat exploding from the neighboring tower, was one of those. Despite her 70 years of age, Ms Ilachinski, an architect working on the 91st floor of Tower 2 at World Trade Center, the south tower, went for the stairs. Twelve floors above her, Judy Wein, a manager, screamed and set off too.
But others up and down the 110 floors, many without clear views of the damage across the way and thus unclear about what was happening, were not so sure. And the 18 minutes before the next plane would hit were ticking off.
Among the uncertainty about what was the best thing to do, formal announcements inside the south tower instructed people to _ , assuring them that the building was sound and the threat was limited to the other tower.
Some left, others stayed, some began to climb down and, when met with more announcements and other warning to stop or return, went back up. The decisions made in those instants proved to be of great importance, because many who chose to stay, were doomed   when the second jet crashed into the south tower killing many and stranding (...) many more in the floors above where the jet hit.
One of those caught in indecision  was the manager at Fuji Bank USA. Richard Jacobs of Fuji Bank left the 79th floor with the other office workers, but on the 48th floor they heard the announcement that the situation was under control. Several got in the lifts and went back up two minutes or so before the plane crashed into their floor.","{

"People in Shanghai can quench their thirst with high quality water if the Shanghai Water Authority (SWA) is able to make good on its word. It has vowed to make the city's water match its status as a world class city.
""The current tap water quality meets national standards, but, compared with that of the European Union and the United States, it still needs to be improved."" said the SWA's director general, Hang Jiayi.
In other developed countries, water fountains can be found almost everywhere--people do not bother with bottled drinking water.
By 2020, the water of the Huangpu River will be treated to reduce the amount of organic waste in it. Major water works that draw water from the Huangpu will need more treatment facilities to improve the colour, texture, ammonia and nitrogen content before 2010.
These treatment facilities are expected to cost 4 billion yuan, something that could affect the price of water, according to Chen Yin, SWA's deputy director general.
Chen said that replacing water pipes was also a key project. The city's aged pipes are mostly to blame for the bad water quality.
The SWA has started the water facilities renovation work, including the more than 14,000 kilometres of indoor piping, 107,000 tanks on top of the buildings, and more than 6,000 underground facilities.
World Water Day came on March 22, and this year's theme is ""Water for the future"". Beijing is also drawing up plans during China's Water Week, which runs until March 28.
By 2010, the water for the Shanghai EXPO is to be above World Health Organization standards. And, the people of Beijing will be able to drink their tap water as well.","{

"To write a great news story, you have to make sure it is correct, relevant   and fresh.
For a start, all the information in a story must be correct. Not only the spelling and grammar, but also the facts.
Any mistakes that show up in a story can get a newspaper into big trouble.
For example, if a newspaper said that Yang Liwei was the first man to go into space, it would be wrong. He wasn't the first. The newspaper would probably lose lots of readers because of that mistake.
A news story does not only have to be correct, but it must also be relevant to its readers. People are mostly interested in news that happens near to them. That's why you care more about what happens at your school than at schools in America. It's also why newspapers in Beijing don't talk much about news in Shanghai or Hong Kong.
Make sure it's fresh.
Finally, news must always be fresh. When you pick up your evening newspaper, you want to read about news that happened that day. You don't want to read about news from last week!
So, now you know what makes a good news story. Have a look at our paper and see if it's full of good news! You can try writing a news story for our paper like a real reporter.","{

"According to a joint survey by the Social Investigation Center of China Youth Daily and the news center of Tencent.com,76.9% of the 5,21l respondents ,all being youths in their 20s, believe the society needs chutouniao(""leading birds"")who dare to take risks to show their worth,although,as the Chinese, saying goes, ""The leading bird gets shot first.""or ""One who takes the lead usually bears the brunt of an attack.""
About 58.2%of the respondents think that one has to work hard at all times, and one must know how to show off when the chance comes.53%of them also believe that it is necessary to be aggressive ,sometimes.

"The world's most famous awards, the Nobel Prizes, are given for achievements that benefit humankind. Ironically they are named for a 19thcentury scientist who invented powerful explosives that came to be used as weapons of war.
Alfred Nobel, a Swedish-born chemist who died in 1896, was known by some as ""The Mad Scientist,"" and by others as ""The Merchant of Death."" He was really pacifist, who at one time believed that his explosives could end warfare. Later, he realized that he was wrong.
""High explosives will not stop men from war,"" he wrote. ""Nobody will benefit from my inventions except manufacturers of war materials, some generals, and diplomats.""
Nobel was born in Sweden in 1833. His father was an architect and inventor who moved to Russia. With only one year formal schooling, Nobel became a chemist and inventor by the age of 16.
He was also excellent in languages, speaking English, Russian, German, and French in addition to Swedish. He wrote poetry. His study of explosives began with manufacturing liquid nitroglycerin for use in mining and construction. But in 1864, the factory blew up, killing his youngest brother and four others. He then discovered that liquid nitroglycerin could be dried and handled safely to be a mixture, which can explode.
He called the mixture dynamite, after the Greek word dynamis, meaning ""power."" He then perfected a more powerful form of dynamite that made him a multimillionaire. When he died, his fortune was about $9 million.
Nobel never married, and he left his fortune to what has since become known as the Nobel Prizes. The money is invested and the interest is given out every year as prizes for the most important work in six fields: Physics, Chemistry, Physiology or Medicine, Literature, and Peace. Nobel Prize winners receive money, a gold medal, and a diploma.
Prizes were first awarded in 1901, and the list of Nobel laureates  contains many well-known names: Albert Einstein in Physics, Marie Curie in Chemistry, Toni Morrison and William Faulkner in Literature, Martin Luther King, Jr., for Peace.","{

"Mark Twain was a great writer. He was from the USA. He was born in 1835. He was also a famous speaker. He was famous for his sense of humour. Many people liked to listen to him talk because he liked to tell some interesting stories to make people laugh all the time.
One day Mark Twain was going to a small town because of his writing. Before he was going to leave, one of his friends said to him that there were always a lot of mosquitoes  in the town and told him that he'd better not go there. Mark Twain waved   his hand and said, ""It doesn't matter. The mosquitoes are no relatives of mine. I don't think they will come to visit me.""
After he arrived at the town, Mark Twain stayed in a small hotel near the station. He went into his room, but when he was just about to have a rest, quite a few mosquitoes flew about him. The waiters felt very sorry about that. ""I'm very sorry, Mr. Mark Twain. There are too many mosquitoes in our town."" One of them said to him.
Mark Twain, however, made a joke, saying to the waiter, ""The mosquitoes are very clever. They know my room number. They didn't come into the wrong room."" What he said made all the people present laugh heartily.

"Sometimes you need to make phone calls to get a job. Calling is the first step where you can show your ability to an employer. Here are some tried and true tips:
Get the person responsible
You need to talk directly to the person who would supervise you. In a small business, you might ask to speak to the ""person in charge"". In a larger one, you would ask for the name of the person in charge of the particular department you're interested in.
Get the name of the person
If you don't have the name of the person you need to speak to, ask for it. Usually, you will be given the supervisor's name and your call will be transferred to him or her.
Get past the receptionist
In some cases, receptionists and secretaries will try to screen out your call. If they find out that you're looking for a job, they may transfer you to the Personnel Department or ask you to send an application or resume. Here are some ways to keep from getting screened out:
* Call back
Call back a day later and say you are getting ready to send some correspondence   to the person who manages such and such. You want to use the correct name and title and request that they give you this information. And this approach usually gets you what you need. Say ""thank you"" and call back in a day or so. Then ask for the supervisor or manager by name.
* Call when the secretary is out
You are likely to get right through if you call when the receptionist is out to lunch. Other good times are just before and after normal work hours. Less experienced staff members are likely to answer the phone and put you right through.
Ask three times for an interview
Sometimes, the supervisor you contact just simply rejects you. Then, you can try asking three times for an interview! Although this approach does not always work, asking the third time works more often than most people would believe.
Arrange a time
If the person agrees to an interview, arrange a specific date and time.","{

"The Parthenon  in Athens is a building with a long and complex  history. Built nearly 2,500 years ago as a temple celebrating the Greek goddess Athena, it was for thousands of years the church of the Virgin Mary of the Athenians, then a mosque  , and finally a ruin. The building was changed and the sculptures  much damaged over the centuries. By 1800 only about half of the original sculptural decoration remained.
Between 1801 and 1805, Lord Elgin, the British ambassador to the Ottoman Empire , which controlled Athens, acting with the full knowledge and permission of the Ottoman authorities,removed about half of the remaining sculptures from the fallen ruins and from the building itself. Lord Elgin loved Greek history and transported the sculptures back to Britain. The arrival of the sculptures in London had a huge effect on the European public, greatly increasing interest in ancient Greek culture and influencing contemporary artistic trends. These sculptures were gained from Lord Elgin by the British Museum in 1816 and since then they have all been on show to the public, free of charge.
Since the early 1980s, however, the Greek government has argued for the return of all the Parthenon sculptures in the British Museum. They have also challenged the British Museum Board of Trustees' legal title to the sculptures.
The British Museum, however, insists that it exists to tell the story of cultural achievement throughout the world, from the dawn of human history over two million years ago until the present day. The museum considers itself an important resource for the world: the breadth and depth of its collection allows the world public to re-examine cultural identities and explore the complex network of interconnected world cultures.
It also says that, within the context of this unparalleled collection, the Parthenon sculptures are an important representation of ancient Athenian civilization. Each year millions of visitors admire the artistry of the sculptures and gain insights on how ancient Greece influenced -- and was influenced by -- the other civilizations that it came across.","{

Why aren't there many factories like the Symi factory?
In some places, the sun isn't hot enough, or it doesn't shine every day. In these places other ways to heating  sea water can be used. These ways cost more money, but they work faster than the sun. By boiling  sea water with high heat,a lot of fresh water can be made quickly. But heating is not the only way to get fresh water from salt water. Other ways are tried. One way is freezing . The fresh part of salt water freezes first. To get fresh water, the pieces of ice are taken out.

"Saying no starts small
'All right then-just one more piece...' Words every girl has said when they are faced with the delicious cheesecake. Of course, many of us know we may eat the whole thing in the end.
It isn't just girls. Most of us find it hard to say 'no' to something attractive, However, scientists now say that willpower is very important to success and a happy life.
Scientists in different countries have been studying the effects of willpower on people's lives for a long time. The results are similar, according to an article on February 7 in the Guardian, a famous British newspaper.
In one experiment, scientists told young children that they could either have a marshmallow  now, or two marshmallows in 15 minutes. Waiting obviously needed more willpower. Scientists then continued studying the children as they grew up. They wanted to see if some children always had stronger willpower. They also wanted to see how having stronger willpower affected their lives.
Years later, scientists found that the children who had waited for two marshmallows were all healthier, happier and richer adults. Oppositely, the children who had shown weaker willpower at that young age were more likely to be in low-paid jobs, to be overweight, to have social problems.
But there is hope, Roy F Baumeister, an American social psychology  professor  told the Guardian. Baumeister says we can train our willpower just like we train our muscles.  Even a little practice can strengthen our overall self-control if we do it regularly.
You could start by making yourself stand up straight, speaking in complete sentences, or using a computer mouse with the other hand. Scientists have found that people who manage to change little habits often perform much better in laboratory willpower tests.
Like muscles, willpower can 'get tired'. Don't try to do too many things at the same time, or when you don't have enough energy, for example when you are ill.  If you already feel tired, you can try to recharge  your willpower with a good night's sleep and by eating well.","{

"As the price of a college degree continues to rise, there's growing evidence that the monetary  payoff isn't quite as big as often advertised. The best estimate now is that a college degree is worth about $300,000 in today's dollars--nowhere near the million figure that is often quoted.
""That million number has driven me crazy!"" says Sandy Baum, a Skidmore economist who studied the value of a college degree for the College Board last year.
Baum's research showed that college graduates earn, on average, about $20,000 a year more than those who finished their educations at high school. Add that up over a 40-year working life and the total differential is about $800,000, she figures. But since much of that bonus is earned many years from now, taking away the impact of inflation means that$800,000 in future dollars is worth only about $450,000 in today's dollars.
Then, if you remove the cost of a college degree--about ,$30,000 in tuition and books for students who get no aid and attend public in-state universities--and the money a student could have earned at a job instead of attending school, the real net value in today's dollars is somewhere in the $300,000 range, a number confirmed by other studies.
But, especially these days, that still makes a college degree one of the most _ investments a person can make, Baum notes.
Better yet, college graduates can go on to earn advanced degrees, which return even bigger payoffs. The average holder of a bachelor's degree earns about$51,000 a year, Baum calculates. But those who've gone on to earn MBAs, law degrees, or other professional degrees earn about $100,000 a year.
In addition, Baum found that there are plenty of other rewards for a degree. The quality of the jobs college graduates get is far better, for example. College graduates are more likely to get jobs with health insurance. And it is easier for them to find and hold jobs. The unemployment rate for college graduates was just 2.2 percent last year, half the unemployment level of those with only high school diplomas.
There are lots of other nonmonetary benefits as well. College graduates are healthier, contribute more to their communities, and raise kids who are better prepared academically, studies show.
Other researchers have found that the payoff of a degree is especially lucrative for students from low-income families, since the education and degrees give them a chance to break out of low-paying careers.","{

"A survey by an international temporary service agency found that U. S. managers believe that people with a sense of humour do better at their jobs, compared with those who have little or no sense of humour. In fact, about 96 percent of those surveyed said people with a sense of humour do better.
The survey went on to point out that the results suggest that a sense of humour may help light-hearted employees keep their jobs during tough times. And, what's more, it may push them up the corporate ladder past their humourless colleagues. Why? It seems that those with a sense of humour are better communicators and better team players.
Studies have shown that happy workers are more productive. In fact, a researcher at California State University found that humour could help the employees to release tension.
Research done by psychologist Dr. Ashton Trice at Mary Baldwin College in Virginia showed that humour helps us think. When people feel stuck on important projects, they tend to feel angry or depressed.  According to Dr. Trice's research, taking time out to laugh can help us to get rid of negative feelings and allow us to return to a task or move on to another project unaffected by past defeat.
If humour is really this important, then why don't we use it more often on the job? Most likely, the main reason is that many people are unaware of the positive effects of humour in the workplace. However, it is important to realize that some humour is not suitable for the workplace, and that it is often used at wrong times.","{

Le Moan takes them through the ""Lion Laugh""and the ""Laugh Contest"", where participants ""speak""to each other in different ways. And instead of talking, they break into fits of laughter.

"The 1920s was a decade of wealth, decadence  and social changes. They were known as the Roaring Twenties, and the best place to experience this exciting time was New York City. But what was it really like?
Prohibition
In 1919, a new law in the US known as Prohibition made it illegal to buy and sell alcohol. But Prohibition didn't stop people drinking; it just drove the sale of strong alcoholic drink underground. Bootleggers  waited off the coast of New York after dark and brought illegal alcohol into the city.
Jazz
Jazz was the music of New York in the 1920s. In fact, the decade is called Jazz Age. The best place to listen to this new form of music was the Cotton Club in Harlem. All the great jazz musicians played at the Cotton Club, including Louis Armstrong, Dizzy Gillespie and Duke Ellington. Also, in 1942 George Gershwin composed the jazz--influenced Rhapsody in Blue. The piece has been called ""a musical portrait of New York"" and was used by Woody Allen in his filmManhattan.
Art Deco
Art Deco was the most popular style of the 1920s, with bright colors and geometric designs; it can be seen in the art, architecture and inside designs of the period. New York is full of Art Deco buildings, but the most famous ones are the Chrysler Building (built between 1928 and 1930) and the Empire State Building (built between 1930 and 1931).
The Great Depression
On 29th October, 1929, the Roaring Twenties came to a dramatic end. On that day (known as ""Black Tuesday""), the US stock market crashed, causing the Great Depression. The economic downturn lasted ten years and affected most of the Western world. Unemployment in America reached 25% and the country didn't recover until after World War II.","{

"The Italian island of Sardinia recently lost its oldest citizen. Family members say Antonio Todde died in his sleep early this month. Mr. Todde was 112 years old. It was less than three weeks away from his 113thbirthday. Record-keeping experts say he was the world's oldest man.
         His long life and that of other very old Sardinians are the subjects of a scientific project called Akea. Luca Deiana of Sassari University is directing the study. He says the name Akea comes from a traditional greeting on Sardinia. It means""health and life for 100 years"". Professor Deiana and his team started to collect information for the study in 1997. They identified more than 220 Sardinians who were centenarians--100years old or older. His team required three documents to confirm a person's age. They were a government birth record, a church record and a statement by a close family member.
         The Akea study has produced two major findings. The first is Sardinia's extremely high number of centenarians. The island had about 135 centenarians for every one million people. In other Western countries, the average is about seventy five centenarians for every one million people. The second major finding is an unusual rate of female to male centenarians. Sardinia has two women centenarians for every male centenarian. In central Sardinia there are equal numbers of female and male centenarians.
         Studies in other parts of the world have shown a much higher percentage of female centenarians. The Akea study collected information about the health and diet of about 140 of the centenarians. About ninety percent of those in the study agreed to provide blood for scientific testing. The study team hope to identify genetic material in the blood that can be linked to successful aging. Study leaders say there is no single reason why people on Sardinia live so long. They believe the answer is a combination of genetic and environmental conditions.","{

"Parking has long been a major headache for drivers in Shanghai. The Transportation Department is _ a new plan for the city's parking system. There are one million cars on the road in Shanghai but only enough public parking space to provide room for 15 percent of these vehicles . It is no wonder that local drivers get so worried trying to find a place to park.
The city is seeing a rise in private car owners. In March, the city sent out 2,000 private car licenses, the highest number of licenses ever sent out in a month. And prices rose to 14,600 yuan, 500 more than in February. Industry experts say this suggests that local people have a strong, active interest in buying cars.
By the year 2020, the number of automobiles in Shanghai will probably reach two million. If one parking lot is for each car, then a lot of parking space should be built for these vehicles.
Downtown Shanghai is most short of parking space. However, experts point out that simply building more parking lots in downtown areas is not practical and doesn't provide an ideal solution. The idea of "" Park & Ride"" system has been suggested. This means that drivers can leave their vehicles in car parks nearby subway or bus stations and ride public transport to go downtown. Based on this idea, the city will limit the number of parking lots in downtown areas and demand higher parking fees but build more parking areas near main subway and bus stops.","{

"If you're in charge of  a project, the key to success is getting everyone to want to help you. As a director, I point, I suggest, I gently push the actors in the direction  I want them to go.
In the 1986 movie Nothing in Common, Jackie Gleason's character, Max Basner, gets fired (or unemployed) from his job as a clothing salesman. The scene, shot   on a boat, shows Max's despair  about being out of work. I was looking for some gesture that would allow Max to show his feelings.
Jackie had far more experience  at everything than I did, and at first I was frightened (very much afraid). What could I possibly tell ""The Great One"" about acting? Out of fear I decided to direct by suggestion, and I sat down with Gleason to talk about the scene. ""So Max is sad, right?"" I said.
Gleason nodded.
""And he's probably still carrying his pens with his name on them --- the ones he used to hand out to his customers, right?""
Gleason nodded.
"" So what would you want to do with the pens after you were fired?"" He was silent for a moment. ""Why don't I throw them overboard (or all over the boat)?"" I stood up and turned toward the crew. "" Hey, everybody, Jackie has a wonderful idea. Let's shoot it.""
After filming the scene, Gleason called me over and said with a smile, ""Garry, what kind of wonderful idea am I going to have tomorrow?""

"When we think about giving help to developing countries, we often think about giving money so that these countries can build schools and hospitals, buy food and medicine, or find clean water supplies. These seem to be the most important basic needs of the people we are trying to help. However, it's far from enough. Ladies and gentlemen, we've got to come up with some better ideas to help them.
I was very surprised, then, when I read about a plan to make cheap laptop computers for children in developing countries. A man called Nicholas Negroponte invented a cheap laptop computer, which can run without electricity. He decided to invent this computer after he visited a school in Cambodia.
The laptop which Mr. Negroponte has designed is a little different from the normal laptop computers you can buy in the shops. One difference is that it is covered in rubber so that it is very strong and won't be damaged easily. As an electricity supply can be a problem in developing countries, the computer also has a special handle so that children can wind the computer up to give it extra power when needed.
These special laptop computers will cost less than 100 US dollars and Mr. Negroponte wants to build as many as 15 million machines in the first year of production. The idea is that these computers will help the children's education as they will be able to access the Internet. These computers might not help the people in developing countries immediately, but by improving children's education they should help people to find their own solutions to their problems in the long term.
Another idea to help children in developing countries is to recycle old mobile phones so that they can be used again. In the UK, and, probably in many other countries too, millions of mobile phones are thrown away every year. The waste created by throwing away these old phones is very bad for the environment, so it seems to be an excellent idea to recycle them. In this way we will be able to achieve two important goals at the same time. We will reduce the waste we produce and help others. In other words, we will be able to 'kill two birds with one stone', and that is always a good thing.","{

"Studies have documented that smiling is a universal and effective way to lift mood. But in the latest research on the power of the smile, researchers led by Marcus Munafo of the University of Bristol in England found that even seeing smiles on the faces of others can have a profound effect on a person's tendency toward violence or aggression -- that is, as long as that person recognizes the smile as one of happiness, and not as a sneer  .
Munafo and his colleagues conducted a series of experiments involving normal adults and highly aggressive teens referred to a youth program, either by educational authorities or the courts. About 70% of the teens already had a criminal record.
In the first experiment, 40 healthy adults, aged 1830, looked at facial expressions on the computer ranging from happy to angry with increasingly difficult ones to _ in between. Participants were asked how angry they felt and then had to rate the images as displaying either happiness or anger -- there was no option for ""unclear"" or ""unable to tell"". From these ratings, the scientists could generate a score of their preference toward happiness or anger.
Previous research found that aggressive people -- including violent offenders -- tend to consider even a common expression as an unfriendly one. ""You looking at me?"" can easily turn a simple question into a tragic fight.
Based on their original scores, half of the participants were then told by the computer that some of the unclear faces that they had rated as angry should have been scored as happy. This was intended to guide them toward judging the inbetween faces more positively. The other 20 received feedback that simply proved their first choices, creating a control group.
After this training, both groups were tested again and the group that received the biased   feedback shifted its ratings of unclear faces toward the happy side. Participants were also asked to rate their level of angry feelings again after completing the second round of testing. Those who were trained to consider unclear faces as happier reported feeling less angry afterward.
The researchers next focused on the 46 adolescents from the high risk youth program. These teens completed the same testing, but both the youth and the staff reported on the teens' levels of aggressive behavior before the testing started and for two weeks afterward. The teens trained to interpret unclear facial expressions more positively were significantly less aggressive two weeks later.
""The results of our experiments strongly suggest that the understanding of emotional facial expressions plays a causal role in subjective anger and aggressive behavior,""the authors conclude.
That doesn't mean that smiles alone are the answer to violence among adolescents -- previous research in which antisocial youth were trained to better recognize emotions, for example, did not have any effect on their level of aggressive behavior. But this earlier study focused on improving teens' understanding of clear facial signals, not unclear ones. Since unclear signals are more likely to be misunderstood, it may be that violent behavior in some youth exists with their constant misunderstanding of angry expressions where they don't exist, which push them to aggressive responses. The findings suggest that helping young people, particularly those easy to be violent, to learn to give others the benefit of the doubt when they see what they think is a threatening face could help end the vicious   cycle of violence.","{

Of course, neither of them could really do that for you-you would just ""borrow"" their voices.
AT & T labs will start selling speech software that it says is so good at reproducing the sounds of a human voice that it can recreate voices and even bring the voices of long-dead famous people back to life.
The software, which turns printed text into speech, makes it possible for a company to use recordings of a person's voice to say things that the person never actually said.
Possible customers for the software, which is priced in the thousands of dollars, include telephone call centers, companies that make software that reads digital files aloud, and makers of automated voice devices . The advances raise several problems. Who, for example, owns the rights to a famous person's voice? (Some experts even believe that new contracts will be drawn that include voice-licensing clauses.)
And although scientists say the technology is not yet good enough to commit fraud , would the synthesized  voices at last be able to trick people into thinking that they were getting phone calls or digital audio recordings from people they know?

"For most city people, the elevator is an unremarkable machine that inspires none of the enthusiasm or interest that Americans afford trains, jets,and even bicycles. Dr. Christopher Wilk is a member of a small group of elevator experts who consider _ a misunderstanding. Without the elevator, they point out, there could be no downtown skyscrapers or tall buildings, and city life as we know it would be impossible. In that sense, they argue,the elevator's role in American history has been no less significant than that of cars. In fact, according to Wilk?the car and the elevator have been locked in a ""secret war"" for over a century, with cars making it possible for people to spread horizontally  ,and elevators pushing them toward life in close groups of towering vertical  columns.
If we tend to ignore the significance of elevators, it might be because riding in them tends to be such a brief, boring, and even awkward experience^one that can involve unexpectedly meeting people with whom we have nothing in common, and an unpleasant awareness of the fact that we're hanging from a cable in a long passage.
In a new book, Lifted, German journalist and cultural studies professor Andreas Bernard directed all his attention to this experience, studying the origins of elevator and its relationship to humankind and finding that riding in an elevator has never been a totally comfortable experience. ""After 150 years, we are still not used to it"", Bernard said. ""We still have not exactly learned to cope with the mixture of closeness and displeasure."" That mixture, according to Bernard, sets the elevator ride apart from just about every other situation we find ourselves in as we go about our lives.
Today,as the world's urban population explodes,and cities become more crowded, taller, and more crowded, America's total number of elevators--900,000 at last count, according to Elevator World magazine's ""2012 Vertical Transportation Industry""are a force that's becoming more important than ever. And for the people who really, really love them, it seems like high time that we looked seriously at just what kind of force they are.","{

"On Nov.18th,1908,three men went up in a balloon .They started early in London. The headman was Auguste Gaudron,and the other two men were Tannar and Maitland. They had a big balloon and they were ready for a long way.
Soon they heard the sea. They were carrying the usual rope ,and it was hanging down from the basket of the balloon. At the end of the rope they had tied a metal box. This could hold water, or it could be empty. So they were able to change its weight .It was for use over the sea. They were also carrying some bags of sand.
After the sun rose, the balloon went higher. It went up to 3,000 metres, and the air was very cold. The water in the balloon became ice. Snow fell past the men's basket, and they could see more snow on the ground. The men tried to throw out some more sand; but it was hard. They tried to break the icy sand with their knives, but it was not easy. The work was slow and they were still falling, so they had to drop some whole bags of sand. One of them fell on an icy lake and made a black hole in the ice.
At last they pulled the box into the basket. It was still snowing; so they climbed to get away from the snow. They rose to 5,100 metres! Everything became icy. They were so cold that they decided to land. They came down in Poland heavily but safely. They had traveled 1,797 kilometers from London!","{

"The day began with clear sunlight and blue skies.It soon turned into years of war, economic breakdown and political division. Ten years after the attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon on September 11,2001, America has come out of the smoke a very different country.Nearly 3,000 people died on September 11.
Suddenly America had to wake up to the fact that not everyone loves the USS              A.Members of al-Qaeda, the militant group that earned out the attacks, were angry about US support for the Israelis
against Palestinians in the Middle East, about US troops in Saudi Arabia, and about sanctions  
against Iraq.
""September 11 and the years that followed were a shock to our national consciousness,"" said Nicholas Bums, American ambassador to NATO   at the time.The terrorists struck not only the buildings, but also Americans- faith in their power.The fear that America had lost control of events as widespread.
In the name of fighting terrorism, the US launched wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.More than 6,000 Americans have died.Tens of thousands of ordinary people in those countries have also lost their lives.
But deaths are only part of the story.The world was shocked by photographs of Americans torturing   Iraqis in Abu Ghraib prison in Baghdad.David Goldstein, a reporter with The Kansas City Star, questioned American behavior: ""Has torturing so-called terrorists saved American lives or made the values we advocate around the world weaker? ..."" Is that what we've become?""
However, a brief moment of national unity did occur straight after 9/11.""Americans were coming together in an unusually powerful way ...in the ashes.We live in a bittersweet memory of that collective tragedy and collective possibility,"" said filmmaker Ken Burns.
September 11 was that kind of common moment.When it was over, the Harth still turned in its usual way and the stars in the sky shone as before.But the universe had shifted somehow.
Though the world felt the consequence of September 11, more is to come.Ten years on, it still might be too soon to tell.","{

"It was June 15, and in two days I would be turning thirty. I was not sure about entering a new decade of my life and feared that my best years were now behind me.
My daily routine included going to the gym for a workout( ) before going to work. Every morning I would see my friend Nicholas at the gym. He was seventy nine years old and in terrific shape. As I greeted Nicholas on that particular day, he noticed I wasn't full of my usual vitality and asked if there was anything wrong. I told him I was feeling anxious about turning thirty.

We have arrived in the hot, wet city of Bangkok. This is our first trip to Thailand . All the different smells make us want to try the food. We are going to eat something special for dinner tonight. The hotel we are staying in is cheap, and very clean. We plan to stay here for a few days, visit some places in the city, and then travel to Chiang Mai in the North.
Tuesday, March 27th
Bangkok is wonderful and surprising. The places are interesting. We visited the famous market which was on water, and saw a lot of fruits and vegetables.

We will take the train north, stay in Chiang Mai for two days, and then catch a bus to Chiang Rai.

"Dear Friend,
The recent success of children's books has made the general public aware that there's a huge market out there.
And there's a growing need for new writers trained to create the $3 billion worth of children's books bought each year ... plus stories and articles needed by over 650 publishers of magazines for children and teenagers.
Who are these needed writers? They're ordinary folks like you and me.
But am I good enough?
I was once where you might be now. My thoughts of writing had been pushed down by self-doubt, and I didn't know where to turn for help.
Then, I accepted a free offer from the Institute to test my writing aptitude ,and it turned out to be the inspiration I needed.
The promise that paid off
The Institute made the same promise to me that they will make to you, if you show basic writing ability:
You will complete at least one manuscript  suitable to hand in to a publisher by the time you finish our course.
I really didn't expect any publication before I finished the course, but that happened. I sold three stories. And I soon discovered that was not unusual at the Institute.
Since graduation, I have authored 34 nationally published children's books and over 300 stories and articles.
Free test and brochure
We offer a free aptitude test and will send you a copy of our brochure describing our recognized home-study courses on the basis of one-on-one training.
Realize your writing dream today. There's nothing sadder than a dream delayed until it fades forever.
Sincerely,
Kristi

"Americans love dogs, all types of dogs: small dogs, big dogs, lapdogs  . Each year, people spend billions of dollars on their four-legged pals, making sure the lovable dogs have enough food to eat and lots of toys to play with.
Dogs love people, too. They lick their faces, protect their homes. Where did these four-legged companions come from? Some scientists believe that they have found the answer.
Scientists have long known that dogs evolved from  wolves. Exactly when the transformation from wolf to dog actually took place, however, remains a mystery.
Some said dogs evolved as a separate species 135,000 years ago in two parts of the world. One group of dogs developed in Europe and Asia from Asian wolves. The other group evolved in North, Central, and South America from American wolves.
Now researchers say those theories are wrong. New studies suggest that _ dogs first appeared 15,000 years ago in eastern Asia. Scientists also say that every modern dog descended from approximately five female Asian wolves, the mother of all modern dogs.
Scientists suspect dogs first set paws in North America by following settlers across a land bridge that once linked northern Asia and North America.","{

"Burmese pythons    are some of the biggest snakes in the world and also one of the biggest problems in Florida's wetlands. So state officials have asked hunters to lend a hand.
The pythons are originally from Asia. Brought to the US as pets or zoo animals, some were released or broke free into the wild and found Florida's warm weather to be perfect for a new settlement. It is estimated that tens of thousands now live in the everglades and the state's marshy wetlands.
These supersize snakes are invasive species. ""The problem is with animals,"" says Carli Segelson, spokesperson for the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission. "" The pythons eat native birds, reptiles, and small mammals, many of which are threatened species. "" Since the python moved in,  several native species,  such as bobcats and rabbits,  have   largely disappeared from Florida's wetlands:' So the Florida government has invited hunters to   assist in solving this severe environmental problem.  People will be allowed to hunt pythons  around their breeding grounds for one month, starting on January 12.
Officials are even offering cash prizes to whoever kills the most pythons and to whoever  kills the longest Burmese pythons. They are hoping the contest will significantly reduce the  population of this dangerous invader.
""Our goal is to help get rid of the pythons from the wild, educate the public about the  snakes' impact on the Florida ecosystem, and inform them of what impacts non-native pets can  have if allowed into the wild, "" Segelson said.  Experts say it's unlikely the snakes will ever be  removed from the wild in Florida. But they hope to bring the python problem under control and  prevent the snakes from doing more harm.","{

"People in Shanghai can quench their thirst with high quality water if the Shanghai Water Authority (SWA) is able to make good on its word. It has vowed to make the city's water match its status as a world class city.
""The current tap water quality meets national standards, but, compared with that of the European Union and the United States, it still needs to be improved."" said the SWA's director general, Hang Jiayi.
In other developed countries, water fountains can be found almost everywhere--people do not bother with bottled drinking water.
By 2020, the water of the Huangpu River will be treated to reduce the amount of organic waste in it. Major water works that draw water from the Huangpu will need more treatment facilities to improve the colour, texture, ammonia and nitrogen content before 2010.
These treatment facilities are expected to cost 4 billion yuan, something that could affect the price of water, according to Chen Yin, SWA's deputy director general.
Chen said that replacing water pipes was also a key project. The city's aged pipes are mostly to blame for the bad water quality.
The SWA has started the water facilities renovation work, including the more than 14,000 kilometres of indoor piping, 107,000 tanks on top of the buildings, and more than 6,000 underground facilities.
World Water Day came on March 22, and this year's theme is ""Water for the future"". Beijing is also drawing up plans during China's Water Week, which runs until March 28.
By 2010, the water for the Shanghai EXPO is to be above World Health Organization standards. And, the people of Beijing will be able to drink their tap water as well.","{

"I dropped out of Reed College after the first 6 months, but then stayed around as a drop-in     for another l8 months or so before I really quit. So why did I drop out?
It started before I was born. My biological mother was a young, unmarried college graduate student, and she decided to, put me up for adoption. She felt very strongly that I should be adopted by college graduates, so everything was all set for me to be adopted at birth by a lawyer and his wife. Except that when I popped out they decided at the last minute that they really wanted a girl. So my parents, who were on a waiting list, got a call in the middle of the night asking: ""We have an unexpected baby boy; do you want him?"" They said: ""Of course. "" My biological mother later found out that my mother had never graduated from college and that my father had never graduated from high school. She refused to sign the final adoption papers, She only gave in a few months later when my parents promised that would someday go to college.
And 17 years later I did go to college. But I artlessly chose a college that was almost as expensive as Stanford, and ail of my working class parents' savings were being spent on my college tuition. After six months, I couldn't see the value in it. I had no idea what I wanted to do with my life and no idea how college was going to help me figure it out. And here I was spending all of the money my parents had saved their entire life. So I decided to drop out and trust that it would all work out OK. It was pretty scary at the time, but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made. The minute I dropped out I could stop taking the required classes that didn't interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting.
It wasn't all romantic. I didn't have a dorm room, so I slept on the floor in friends' rooms, I returned coke bottles for the $ 5 deposits to buy food with, and I would walk the 7 miles across town every Sunday night to get one good meal a week at the Hare Krishna temple. I loved it. And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.","{

"Sir,
Just over six months ago, I saw an advertisement in the Morning Mail for a set of the complete works of William Shakespeare. Your company, Cosmo books Ltd., offered this set (eight books of plays and two books of poetry) at what was claimed to be a 'remarkable' price: fifteen pounds and fifty pence, including postage and packing. I had wanted a set of Shakespeare's plays and poems for some time, and these books, in red imitation leather, looked particularly attractive; so I sent for them.
Two weeks later, the books arrived, together with a set of the complete works of Charles Dickens which I had not ordered. So I returned the Dickens books to you, with a cheque for fifteen pounds and fifty pence for the works of Shakespeare. Two more weeks passed. Then there arrived on my door step a second set of the works of Shakespeare, the same set of novels by Dickens and a six book set of the plays of Moliere, in French. Since I do not read French, these were of no use to me at all. However, I could not afford to post all these books back to you, so I wrote to you at the end of August of last year, instructing you to come and collect all the books that I did not want, and asking you not to send any other books until further notice.
You did not reply to that letter. Instead you sent me a bill for forty two pounds, and a set of the plays of Schiller, in German. Since then, a new set of books has arrived every two weeks, the works of Goethe, the poems of Milton, the plays of Strindberg; I hardly know what I have. The books are still all in their boxes, in the garage, and my car has to stand in the rain outside.
I have no room for any more books, and even if I read from now until the Last Judgment, I should not finish reading all the books that you have sent me.
Please send no more books, send no more bills, send no more angry letters demanding payment. Just send one large lorry and take all the books away, leaving me only with the one set of the complete works of Shakespeare for which I have paid.
Yours faithfully,
SIMON WALKER","{

"Although April did not bring us the rains we all hoped for, and although the Central Valley doesn't generally experience the sound and lightning that can go with those rains, it's still important for parents to be able to answer the youthful questions about thunder and lightning.
The reason these two wonders of nature are so difficult for many adults to explain to children is that they are not very well understood by adults themselves. For example, did you know that the lightning we see flashing down to the earth from a cloud is actually flashing up to a cloud from the earth? Our eyes trick us into thinking we see a downward motion when it's actually the other way around. But then, if we believed only what we think and we see, we'd still insist that the sun rises in the morning and sets at night.
Most lightning flashes take place inside a cloud, and only a   few can be seen jumping between two clouds or between earth and a cloud. But, with about 2,000 thunderstorms taking place above the earth every minute of the day and night, there's enough  _ to produce about 100 lightning strikes on earth every second.
Parents can use thunder and lightning to help their children learn more about the world around them. When children understand that the light of the lightning flashing reaches their eyes almost at the same moment, but the sound of the thunder takes about 5 seconds to travel just one mile, they can begin to time the interval   between the flash and the crash to learn how close they were to the actual spark  .","{

"Tigers are terrible animals, but a cat is a cute animal.    As a mother, the Chinese-American writer Amy Chua is just a tiger . Her book, Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother (<<>> ), tells us how she gives her two children education.    She says that being strict is the only way to train a child's talent. Her kids had to obey the following rules. To begin with, her kids weren't allowed to watch TV or play computer games. Then, they were not allowed to "" hang out "" with other kids after school. They had to be the top students in their class. And they had to practice the piano and the violin for hours every day. Of course, she believes this has brought a lot of problems for herself and her kids. But she doesn't mind because her kids have become great. Chua says, like her, most Asian mothers are tigers because they believe their children can achieve a lot if they're pushed hard enough. She says American mothers are really cats. They care more about their children's self-respect  . They don't want to be strict with their kids because this may hurt their feelings. With soft words and understanding, they encourage their children to choose for themselves. So is a tiger mom better than a cat mom? It may also depend on the child.","{

"Comparative thinking and behavior is quite typical among teenagers,  but it is the responsibility of the parent to set limits and hold firmly to them. Frequently, a parent will tell me in frustration about how their child has complained about not having the very best in fashion design like their friends, or the latest electronic gadgetry that all the other kids own.
Parents need to teach their children selfconfidence. Those who are selfconfident resist the urge to compare themselves to other people, and do not overestimate others' experience while diminishing their own. But some people may have a mantra signified by the slogan, if only. ""If only I had the money of my brother; if only I was smart like my classmates; if only I was as goodlooking as my friends.""
Comparing oneself with others is a trap. People who compare themselves with other individuals tend to feel that they are not good enough.  They tend to perseverate about their shortcomings. Even if they try their best,it is not good enough because they can always find someone who performs at a higher level. When people compare, they generally focus on their negative traits. They ignore all that is going right in their life. They also tend to minimize their success and dismiss positive gestures and compliments.
Those who are confident listen to their own inner voice. They are not influenced by other people's view of events. They are not overly impressed by others' success, money, health,and material possessions. They do not believe that others have a greater sense of emotional wellbeing than they do.
Recently,  The Harvard Mental Health Letter published an article which  indicated  that  people  with  chronic pain had as significant a sense of wellbeing as those without chronic pain. However, those with chronic pain tended to overestimate the emotional wellbeing of physically healthy people. The study confirmed that it is how we view events that is important, not the nature of our circumstances which may include making comparisons.","{

"A huge cloud of dust rose and an overpass disappeared. This was the scene in Zhuzhou,Hunan Province on May 17.Nine people were killed and 16 injured.
Things were similar last year in the Sichuan earthquake. Thousands of people were buried in the ruins and lost their lives. What if we could have warned them?
People are always _ to find a way of preventing buildings' collapse. Better materials and technology help,but they are not a solution.
Just like humans,a building has its own life cycle from ""birth"" to ""death"".If we know when a building is going to collapse,we can repair it in advance or get out of it before it falls.
Now,scientists at the University of Illinois have developed a material that turns red before it breaks. The invention could be used in things like climbing ropes or bridge supports.
The research was led by Nancy Sottos,a professor at the university's Beckman Institute,and Douglas Davis,a graduate research assistant.
The secret behind the colorchanging material is a type of molecule  .A molecule is a group of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Imagine you and your friends standing in a circle,holding hands. Each person stands for one atom,your hands represent the bonds,and the entire circle represents a molecule. If one person lets go of his or her hands,the molecule changes color.
The research team put the molecule into a soft material. When the researchers stretched the material,it turned bright red for a few seconds before it broke into two pieces. When they repeatedly stretched and relaxed the material,without breaking it,it only turned a little red.
The major problem is that light can get rid of the red color. When the team shone bright light on the molecule,the broken bond was fixed,and the color disappeared.
If the bright light keeps the red color from appearing,the material's warning system will be useless. Scientists still have a lot of work to do before the colorchanging molecules can be used outside the lab.","{

"Not all memories are sweet. Some people spend all their lives trying to forget bad experiences. Violence and traffic accidents can leave people with terrible physical and emotional scars. Often they relive   these experiences in nightmares.
Now American researchers think they are close to developing a pill, which will help people forget bad memories. The pill is designed to be taken immediately after a frightening experience. They hope it might reduce, or possibly erase  , the effect of painful memories.
In November, experts tested a drug on people in the US and France. The drug stops the body releasing chemicals that fix memories in the brain. So far the research has suggested that only the emotional effects of memories may be reduced, not that the memories are erased.
The research has caused a great deal of argument. Some think
is a bad idea, while others support it. Supporters say it could lead to pills that prevent or treat soldiers' troubling memories after war.
They say that there are many people who suffer from terrible memories.""Some memories can ruin people's lives. They come back to you when you don't want to have them in a daydream or nightmare. They usually come with very painful emotions,""said Roger Pitman, a professor of psychiatry   at Harvard Medical School.""This could relieve a lot of that suffering.""
But those who are against the research say that changing memories is very dangerous because memories give us our identity  . They also help us all avoid the mistakes of the past. ""All of us can think of bad events in our lives that were horrible at the time but make us who we are. I'm not sure we'd want to wipe those memories out,"" said Rebecca Dresser, a medical ethicist  .
Some people fear that although the drug would first be used in only very serious cases, it would become more and more common. ""People always have the ability to misuse science,""said Joseph LeDoux, a New York University memory researcher. ""All we want to do is help people have better control of memories.""","{

"Health officials issued a waring over common energy-saving lghtbulbs  after research showed some types could potentially harm the skin and may even raise the risk of cancer.
A study by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) found that some eco-friendly lightbuulbs release levels of ultraviolet (UV)   radiation that are above recognized safety limits. The agency urged people who work with lamps nearby to avoid spending more than one hour within a foot of the eco-friendly bulbs. The warning was directed at those using desk lamps for long periods, such as jewellery makers, and others who might have lights close to their faces, such as car mechanics.
John O'Hagan, a scientist at the HPA's centre for radiation, chemical and environmental dangers, began tests on the ligthbulbs after patient groups raised concern about them. Among the groups were patients with a skin disease called lupus, which makes people highly sensitive to light.
The tests measured UV light from the lamps and found the highest levels of UV radiation, measured 2cm from the lightbulbs, were _ to being outside in direct sunlight in the summer. The most immediate risk from the lightbulbs is a reddening of the skin similar to sunburn, but there is also a small increased risk of skin cancer associated with this, again similar to that of sunburn.
The risk of health problems from the lightbulbs was not so high that people should remove them from their homes. People are advised to avoid using open lightbulbs for long close work until the problem is sorted out. It has confirmed that the government will not be reviewing its strategy on introducing energy efficient lightbulbs.","{

"Researchers designing the 'classroom of the future' have found that multi-touch, multi-user desks can improve skills in mathematics.
New results from a 3-year project working with over 400 pupils, mostly 8-10 year olds, show that cooperation learning increases both fluency   and flexibility in maths.It also shows that using an interactive 'smart' desk can have Benefits over doing mathematics on paper.
Using multi-touch desks in the new classroom, the children were able to work together in new ways to solve problems using inventive solutions.Seeing what your friends are doing, and being able to fully participate in group activities, offers new ways of working in class, the researchers say.The 'Star Trek classroom' could also help learning and teaching in other subjects.
Lead researcher, Professor Liz Burd, said: ""Our aim was to encourage far higher levels Of active student engagement, where knowledge is obtained by sharing, problem-solving and creating, rather than by passive listening.This classroom enables both active engagement and equal access.""
""We found our tables encouraged students to cooperate more effectively.We were delighted to observe groups of students improving their understanding of mathematical concepts.Such cooperation just did not happen when students used paper-based approaches.""
The teacher plays a key role in the classroom and can send tasks to different tables to individuals and groups.The teacher can also send one group's answers on to the next group to work on and add to, or to the board for a class discussion.A live feedback   of the desks goes directly to the teacher who can come quickly to help an individual while allowing the group work to continue.
Such a classroom may be some way off being a regular feature of schools across the.World due to the costs in setting it up.However, in just 3 years the project team have noted major improvements in the technology, and a reduction in costs.","{

"How to improve my life? Many people think that they have to accept whatever life throws at them. They'll say, ""This is my fate, my destiny. I cannot change it.""
Of course not! You don't have to suffer needlessly. Your destiny depends on you, not on any other external factors.
I know someone who says she just accepts what life gives her because she has done everything she can to improve it. Guess what her lifestyle is? She wakes up in the morning, goes to work, comes back home, relaxes, chats with people, watches TV, then goes to sleep. Next day, the same routine cycle follows.
Huh! Is this what she calls ""doing her best""? She believes she has tried her best and just accepts it in her heart that this is the life that God has intended for her to live; that her luck can only change if God wills it.  Of course God wants us to be happy and live our life to the fullest, but we have to do our share of exerting  the effort to live the life of our dreams.
Remember that you reap what you sow. You just don't sit around and wait for a million dollars to fall from the sky. You have to get off the couch, get your eyes off the TV screen, get your hands off the phone. Don't expect your luck to change unless you do something about it. If something goes wrong, don't just regard it as a temporary setback; but use it as feedback. Learn your lesson, make the most of the situation, and do something to solve the problem. It's not enough to think positively; you also have to act positively.
If someone's life is in the trouble, do you just hope and pray that things will turn out fine? Of course not! You get to do anything you can to save the person. So it is with your own life. It is not enough to hope for the best, but you have to do your best. In other words, don't just stand (or sit ) there, do something to improve your life.","{

"Not all vegetables need lots of sunshine. Mark Hoffman and his wife own a bed-and-breakfast guesthouse in rural Kempton, Illinois. They often serve their guests fresh products from the garden.
The Hoffmans have been growing food and flowers for twenty-five years. For almost ten of those years, Mr. Hoffman has been experimenting and working with shade   plantings. He says, ""The bottom line here is that most plants will produce more in full sun. But if you do not have full sun, there are other choices.""
For example, he grows tomatoes near oak trees. Oak trees can produce a lot of shade. But Mr. Hoffman says his tomato plants grow as long as they get five hours' direct sunshine a day, especially morning sun. Not only does this go against the traditional advice that tomatoes need six, eight, even twelve hours' full sun a day. It also shows how plants and tree roots can share nutrients and water.
Mr. Hoffman says plants with wider leaves seem to do better in shady environments. He also found that his potatoes did better partly in shade than in full sun.
Moving them out of the sun helped control an insect problem. Mr. Hoffman does not use pesticide  . Instead, he planted the potatoes in the shade, especially on the east side of the tree. The potatoes get morning sun, but they are shaded during the hottest part of the day. Some insects dislike shade, and the hottest part day is when they do the worst of their damage.
Time of day, sun intensity  , shadows from trees, walls and buildings all influence how much sunlight falls on plants. And people interested in shade planting should also remember something else. The term ""shade"" can describe different amounts of darkness. It can even mean different things in different parts of the world.","{

"The Wal-Mart in Cleburne, Texas, was crowded. People were waiting in long lines at checkout counters to pay for small things that would be next-morning treasures under someone's Christmas tree.
The woman standing in cashier Jeffrey Kandt's line seemed to be living on the edge of subsistence . Her clothes were worn and her hands were those of a person who'd worked hard for what she had. She held a single item in her arms as she patiently waited to move to the front of the line -- a Sony CD player. She had saved all year for this. With tax, the total would be close to $ 220.
As the woman got close to the cashier, she suddenly shouted, ""Where's my money? All of my money fro my son's gift! Oh no!""
""Why my line?"" Kandt thought as he watched the poor woman searching through her clothes. He was going to have to call his manager to avoid the sale but it would mean a long wait for the customers behind her. ""I am going to go home late tonight,"" Kandt thought.
Then an amazing thing happened. At the back of the line, a man took out his wallet, pulled out $100 and passed it forward. As the cash moved up the line, a twen5ty-dollar bill was added here, and a ten-dollar bill was added there. When the collection finally reached the registewr, Kandt counted $ 220.

"When I entered college in the early 1980s, I had my heart set on being a first-grade teacher. I did all of my observations in others' first-grade classroom. I interviewed for my first job in a first-grade classroom. At last the district offered me a job---as a fifth-grade teacher in an inner-city building, considered at the time to be one of our district's most difficult tasks. It wasn't the first-grade classroom after I had hoped for, but it was my classroom after I had made such great efforts!
    I managed to deal with everything in first year successfully, while working to form relationships with my students was no easy thing, especially with Alexader. He had learning disabilities in both math and reading. The other children were sometimes unfriendly to him. He was a difficult child to get to open up, but I was determined to make efforts.
    You can imagine my delight when finally, in late spring, Alexander raised his hand during the math class discussion for the first time ever. Thrilled, I immediately called him.
   Well, you can imagine my surprise when he suddenly told a story about his grandma, who had a hole in her head. You see, we were studying fraction that day, and I had just explained that a fraction is ""a part of a whole"". Alexander obviously didn't realize the difference between ""whole"" and ""hole"". ""Homophones ''I told myself,""had better be tomorrow's English lesson.""
   Acknowledging Alexander that day was exactly what he needed from me. We had suddenly developed a special relationship. Alexander felt such a connection to me after that, that he even went one step further.
    I arrived at the school the following morning and was surprised to find Alexander and his grandma waiting for me. Grandma began by saying,""Alexander said he told you that I had a hole in my head.""I smiled nervously and said ,""Don't worry. You know kids! They have great imaginations""Grandma replied,""You didn't believe him, did you?""""No, of course not,""I said .Well, just at that time, Grandma proudly showed the hole in her head.
   I will never forget that day, and the lesson that I learned from being Alexander's teacher.

"If you are lost in the mountains, stay calm in the face of darkness, loneliness, and the unknown. It will greatly increase your chances of survival. Many people think that   preparing necessary equipment and knowing how to use it are very important, but in fact eighty percent of mountain survival is your reaction  to fear.
Finding a hiding place
Unnecessary labor   will make you sweat and make you cold. Find a hiding place around you before trying to start your own construction. If you are in a snow-covered area, you may be able to dig a cave in deep snow for protection from the wind. You should try to hide yourself in the middle of the mountain if possible. Stay out of the valleys--- cold air falls, and the valley floor can be the coldest area on the mountain.
Signal  rescuers for help
The best time to signal rescuers is during the day. Signal for help from the highest point possible--- it will be easier for rescuers to see you, and any sound you make will travel farther. If you take a box of matches and a space blanket ( a special blanket for traveling ), build three smoky fires and put your blanket ---gold side facing out --- on the ground.
Do not walk away
It will make finding you more difficult , as search teams will be trying to follow your path and may miss you if you have gone off in a different direction. Searchers often end up finding a car with no one in it. If you get frostbitten  , do not rewarm the affected area until you are out of danger.
You can walk on frostbitten  feet, but once you warm the area and can feel the pain, you will not want to walk anywhere. Try to protect the frostbitten area and keep it dry until you are rescued.","{

He tried to walk there but found he was quite lost. Suddenly he bumped into a stranger. The stranger asked if he could help him. Mr. Smith said he wanted to get to the Houses of Parliament.

"When I first heard about geocaching ,I was skeptical. But the more I thought about it, the more it seemed like an interesting idea.I at least wanted to try it once.
Having familiarized myself with how the game works,I set out in search of my first cache. My trip took me through a series of lively hutong ,past a number of small temples, and right into the courtyard of a quiet youth hotel.I spent several minutes looking around, but couldn't find anything. Just before l was about to give up,I spotted a colorful object in the crack of a wall. Could it be the hidden cache?
At that moment a group of backpackers amved. According to the game's rules, people who are not in the game must not be allowed to find out about secret caches. So I pretended to make a phone call while waiting for them to leave. When the coast was clear,I grabbed the object. It was the cache!  I opened it and pulled out a crumpled sheet of paper with several names and celebratory messages written on it.I added my own and replaced the cache in its hiding place, ready for the next geocacher to find.
It may seem like a simple game, but the idea that there are caches hidden all around us is exciting. Once you're hooked, it's easy to set yourself the goal of finding every single cache in a neighborhood or even an entire city. The real treasure, however, is not the cache itself, but the places it takes you to.
Hunting for further caches has since introduced me to places which I didn't even know existed. Some are peaceful parks, while others are forgotten historical sites.A few caches have even been in places I passed regularly without giving them any thought. Now,Ifeel a much closer connection.","{

"About 10 years ago my daughter was about 2500 kilometers from Newcastle, and rang me one day crying because of an emotional problem she was facing. She was about 20, and in a town known as Ayrlie Beach in Northern Queensland. I asked her what it was that she needed most in that moment, and she replied that she needed support, and my arms around her would be the best thing that she could hope for! Because I couldn't do that in that exact moment, I asked her to describe her surroundings to me (I have  ly no idea 'why', at the time), and said that if she hadn't heard from me in about 30 minutes, she could ring me back. I asked her to stay exactly where she was.
After hanging up the phone, I just sat for a few seconds. After only a very short time a phone number jumped into my head. I rang the number and it was a woman who had bought a house from me about 18 months previously, when I was working in Real Estate. My exact words to her were these, ""Oh, it's you Liz, I have no idea why I'm calling you in particular, but my daughter is in trouble in Ayrlie Beach, and I just got the thought to ring you and tell you that. Have you any idea why?""
""It could be because my son lives there,"" says Liz.
""Oh really, that's got to be it,"" I said. ""Do you mind giving me his phone number, Liz?""
""Of course not, and I can only hope that he can be of some help!""
I rang straight away (only about 5 minutes have passed since telling my daughter that somehow I'd get her help). Fortunately, he answered immediately, and I told him the story of who I was, and why I'd rung.
I gave him the description of my daughter; where she was standing; and that she needed emotional support if he could find it in his heart to help out so unexpectedly like this. ""Oh yes, I can see her,"" he said...""she's right across the street from where I'm standing!"" He walked across the street and told my daughter that her Dad had sent him!
Imagine that...she almost fainted: only about 10 minutes had passed since she had rung me! I believe that she said something like this, ""Wow, Dad's getting pretty good at this stuff!"".

"The first time I heard the actual London Bridge was in Lake Havasu City, Arizona, I thought it was a joke. A stupid joke at that. I mean, what sort of _ would take a perfectly good, perfectly famous bridge and move it halfway around the world to some no-name town in northwest Arizona? Back in 1962 when all this started, Lake Havasu City was nothing. A couple of shops, a couple of homes, and no tourism at all.
It turns out Robert McCulloch is the moron in question, and he wasn't quite the moron I thought he was. His 2.45 million dollar investment in the 130-year-old bridge--which the British government was selling because it was about to fall into the Thames--ended up being the investment of a lifetime. You see McCulloch was a real businessman, among other things, and his money paid off big. He turned Lake Havasu into one of the most visited tourist attractions in Arizona.
It took nine long years to take down the bridge, ship it brick by brick to the middle of nowhere, and build it up again. When it finally did open up in 1971, it was a huge deal covered by the international press.
The bridge is now a popular tourist attraction, and there's even a mini ""English Village"" at the foot of the bridge with souvenirs and real British food so you can have a good old time.
Nowadays Lake Havasu is a busy town with a population of about 56,000 citizens and another2.5 million visitors each year. Most of that is during spring break when the town overflows with energetic boys and girls. Even MTV and the Girls Gone Wild people get in on the action. All thanks to that little bridge.
I don't know about you, but I'm saving my pennies. When the French get sick of that Eiffel Tower, I'll be the first to put money on it. It'll look great in my backyard.","{

"Today's drivers may feel shocked by the high price of petrol when they drive to the gas station. However, the car industry has the technology to solve _ . It's the hybrid car .
What is a hybrid car? Any car that uses two or more sources of power is a hybrid car. Most hybrid cars on the road right now are petrol-electric hybrids. The petrol-electric hybrid car is just what it sounds like -- a cross between a petrol-powered car and an electric car.
A gas-powered car has a fuel tank , which supplies petrol to the engine. An electric car, on the other hand, has a set of batteries that provides electricity for the car.
To be useful to you or me, a car should be able to run at least 300 miles (483 km) before refueling, be capable of  being refueled quickly and easily and fast enough to keep up with the other traffic on the road.
A petrol car meets these requirements but produces a large amount of pollution. An electric car, however, produces almost no pollution, but can only go 50 to 100 miles (80 to 161 km) between recharging . And the problem has been that the electric car is very slow and inconvenient to recharge.
A petrol-electric car combines the advantages of the two power sources into one system that uses both gas power and electric power. Some experts believe that the hybrid car is ""the next generation of smart cars"". A hybrid car can go up to 50% further than a traditional car can on the same amount of gas! It saves driver's money on gas and cuts air pollution!","{

"I teach geography at UNLV three times per week. Last Monday, at the beginning of class, I cheerfully asked my students how their weekend had been. One young man said that his weekend had not been so good. He had his wisdom teeth removed. The young man then asked me why I always seemed to be so cheerful. ""I choose to be cheerful."" I said. Then I told them a story.
In addition to teaching here at UNLV, I also teach out at the community college in Henderson, 17 miles down the freeway from where I live. One day I drove those 17 miles to Henderson. I exited the freeway and turned onto College Drive. I only had to drive another quarter mile down the road to the college. But just then my car died and wouldn't start again. So I left my car there and marched down the road to the college.
As soon as I got there I called AAA  and arranged for a tow truck   to meet me at my car after class. The secretary in the office asked me what had happened. ""This is my lucky day."" I replied, smiling.
""Your car breaks down and today is your lucky day?"" She was puzzled. ""What do you mean?""

Some stay at the camp; others live with host families. The fund pays all money.
The camp is for 8 to 15-year-olds. At camp, children can learn about the stars, see deer and cows and other animals, and go hiking, fishing, and of course swimming. The children learn responsibility  by helping out with chores like making beds and waiting on tables. They also learn a lot from teachers, who are often college students from around the United States and from other countries.
Host families from thirteen states and Canada offer to have children spend the summer with them. Many of these families have their own children. The visiting children become part of the family.

Pendant des mois, l'écureuil terrestre a mangé beaucoup de graines, de champignons et de baies. Maintenant, elle est grosse. La graisse supplémentaire la maintiendra en vie tout l'hiver.

Enfin, elle se faufile à travers un tunnel dans le nid qu'elle a construit. Elle se blottit, enroule sa queue autour d'elle et s'endort. Sauf qu'elle ne dormira pas vraiment. Elle hibernera.

Le corps de l'écureuil terrestre est généralement aussi chaud que le vôtre. Lorsqu'elle hiberne, son corps devient juste plus froid que la glace, mais elle ne gèle pas. En saison chaude, lorsque l'écureuil terrestre est actif, elle utilise la majeure partie de la nourriture qu'elle mange pour produire de la chaleur afin de rester au chaud. Lorsqu'elle hiberne, elle n'a pas besoin de beaucoup de nourriture.

Son cœur ne bat qu'une ou deux fois par minute. Elle ne respirera qu'environ trois fois par minute. Elle ne bougera pas, même si quelqu'un la touche ou lui éclaire les yeux.

Ces changements dans le corps de l'écureuil terrestre lui permettent de survivre à l'hiver.

L'écureuil terrestre ne restera pas en hibernation tout l'hiver. Son corps se réchauffe et devient actif pendant quelques heures toutes les quelques semaines. Pendant l'hiver, ces périodes d'activité utilisent plus de la moitié de l'énergie qu'elle a tant travaillé à stocker. Pourquoi fait-elle ça ?

Les scientifiques ne sont pas sûrs. Certains pensent que les écureuils terrestres arctiques doivent se réchauffer au cas où leur corps aurait besoin de combattre des germes qui les rendraient malades.

En avril ou en mai, l'écureuil terrestre arctique cessera d'hiberner. Elle sera maigre parce qu'elle n'a rien mangé pendant l'hiver. Maintenant, elle n'aura que quelques mois pour avoir des bébés et grossir avant que l'hiver ne revienne.

"Vous partez peut-être en vacances bien méritées en famille ou planifiez un voyage de noces dans un pays étranger. Bien que la découverte d'une nouvelle destination puisse paraître excitante, gardez à l'esprit qu'un peu de préparation peut rendre votre escapade encore plus spéciale.

Voici quelques conseils de voyage qui peuvent minimiser les désagréments qui peuvent survenir lorsque vous ne connaissez pas le pays dans lequel vous voyagez.

Familiarisez-vous avec la culture et les traditions de votre destination.

L'Orient est l'Orient et l'Occident est l'Occident, et jamais les deux ne se rencontreront. Les points de vue de Rudyard Kipling peuvent ne pas paraître entièrement vrais avec le monde qui devient un village global. Cependant, il existe encore des différences qu'il faut prendre en considération.

Il est préférable de se familiariser avec la culture et les traditions du pays que vous visitez. Par exemple, vous voyagez peut-être à Bali, un pays aussi réputé pour ses paysages et ses temples magnifiques que pour la chaleur de ses habitants. Cependant, gardez à l'esprit que vous devez être habillé convenablement pour entrer dans un temple. Si vous y allez en short, il est possible que vous ne soyez pas autorisé à entrer. Tenir compte de ces détails peut faire toute la différence pour votre visite.

Informations générales sur votre destination

Météo : Cela vous aidera à décider ce que vous devez emporter pour le voyage et le séjour.

Devise : Aucun voyage n'est complet sans faire du shopping et rapporter des souvenirs. Il est donc important de se familiariser avec la monnaie, les billets et les pièces et leurs valeurs.

Coût des articles locaux : Cela vous aidera à planifier votre budget et vous donnera également une idée approximative des coûts afin de ne pas être arnaqué lors de vos sorties shopping.

Réservation de l'hébergement : Réservez votre hébergement bien à l'avance. Ceci est particulièrement important si vous voyagez en haute saison et que vous risquez de trouver difficile d'obtenir un hôtel ou une maison d'hôtes dans votre budget.

Gérer les problèmes de langue : Familiarisez-vous avec les mots et les expressions courants pour faciliter vos déplacements. De même, lorsque vous vous déplacez d'un endroit à un autre, notez la destination et l'adresse de votre hôtel dans la langue locale, sinon les chauffeurs de taxi risquent de ne pas comprendre où vous souhaitez aller.

Besoins pratiques

Documents et papiers : Connaissez tous les documents nécessaires pour voyager dans un pays particulier et assurez-vous que tous vos papiers sont complets afin d'éviter des tracas une fois sur place.

Faites deux copies de votre passeport. Gardez-les dans des endroits distincts, par exemple, vous pouvez laisser une copie dans votre chambre et en garder une autre avec un ami. Si votre passeport est perdu ou volé, vous pouvez utiliser la copie pour quitter le pays ou pour faciliter le processus de remplacement.

Envoyez-vous par e-mail toutes les informations importantes telles que les numéros de vos cartes de crédit, les numéros de passeport, les détails de votre permis de conduire, etc. et toute autre information importante en cas d'urgence.

Enfin, effectuez une dernière vérification avant de commencer votre voyage. Vous devriez avoir les éléments suivants : passeport, billets, reçus/accords de réservation de location de voiture et d'hôtel, cartes de crédit, médicaments ou ordonnances, si nécessaire, adresses, mot de passe et toute autre information importante dont vous pourriez avoir besoin. Si tout est en ordre, vous êtes prêt pour un voyage à l'étranger sans encombre.

"La musique est morte ici au printemps dernier, ou plutôt, elle a été tuée par les membres du comité scolaire qui ont ignoré l'importance de la musique et du théâtre dans le cadre du programme du lycée.

Le comité a décidé qu'apprendre aux élèves à passer un test standardisé est plus important qu'un programme dans lequel les élèves peuvent explorer leurs intérêts dans les arts ainsi que dans les matières académiques. Parce que le système scolaire manque de financement, il doit s'assurer que les élèves réussissent le test de maîtrise, faute de quoi il perdra encore plus d'argent. Si les élèves échouent au test standardisé de l'État, ce n'est pas la faute des cours de théâtre et de musique ; ils échouent parce que les cours « académiques » ne sont pas suffisants.

Il est douloureux de penser à combien d'élèves seront découragés de chanter, de jouer et de jouer d'un instrument parce que les programmes scolaires ne sont plus proposés. De nombreuses familles ne peuvent pas se permettre des cours de musique privés, et de nombreux musiciens et artistes potentiels ne trouveront peut-être pas leur vocation s'ils ne sont pas exposés à l'art à l'école. Le fait que le comité scolaire pense que les arts ne valent pas l'investissement fera certainement croire à certains élèves que les arts ne valent pas leur temps ni leur soutien, et le cycle se poursuivra.

Enseigner pour un test ne façonne pas les élèves en des personnes complètes et bien équilibrées. Cela bloque le sens naturel de créer et d'exprimer des sentiments par l'art ; il y a plus dans la vie que la pensée analytique que les mathématiques et l'anglais fournissent. Que se passe-t-il après un test ? Bien sûr, un élève peut obtenir son diplôme, mais il aura des connaissances limitées ; certainement pas une bonne préparation au monde réel.

"Beaucoup de gens ne pensent pas que le numéro 13 soit un numéro porte-bonheur. De nombreux hôtels n'ont pas de 13ème étage. Les étages vont de 12 à 14, et il n'y a pas de numéro 13. Certaines personnes ne s'assiéront jamais à une table avec 12 autres personnes. Elles demanderont à quelqu'un de partir ou demanderont à une autre personne de s'asseoir avec elles.

Personne ne sait vraiment pourquoi les gens n'aiment pas le numéro 13. Une raison possible est que lorsque les gens ont commencé à compter, ils utilisaient dix doigts et deux mains. Cela faisait 12. Ils ne pouvaient pas compter plus.

Certains chrétiens disent que 13 n'est pas un chiffre porte-bonheur car il y avait 13 personnes à un repas la veille de la mort de Jésus.

"""Debrouille-toi et fais quelque chose de toi, mon pote !"" Même si ma mère est décédée, ses paroles résonnent dans ma tête aujourd'hui aussi clairement que lorsque j'étais enfant.
""Bon Dieu !"" dis-je, ""j'ai fait quelque chose de moi-même. Je veux dormir tard comme bon me semble.""
""S'il y a une chose que je ne supporte pas, c'est un lâche."" Sa voix dans ma tête est plus puissante que ma volonté de refuser, alors je me lève du lit.
Avant même la fin de l'école primaire, ma mère avait compris que je n'avais pas les qualités pour faire fortune ou gagner l'amour du public. Elle a donc commencé à me pousser vers le travail avec les mots. _ .Il semblait y avoir un gène des mots qui se transmettait du grand-père de sa mère*
La plus grande preuve était Edwin, le cousin germain de ma mère. Il était rédacteur en chef du New York Times et s'était fait un nom dans sa carrière.
En 1947, j'ai obtenu mon diplôme de Johns Hopkins et j'ai postulé pour un emploi au Baltimore Sun en tant que reporter de police. C'était 30 dollars par semaine. Lorsque j'ai protesté en disant que le salaire était honteux pour un homme instruit, ma mère a refusé de me plaindre. ""Si tu travailles dur à ce poste"", a-t-elle dit, ""tu pourras peut-être en faire quelque chose.""
Après un certain temps, on m'a demandé de couvrir les diplomates dans diverses ambassades africaines. Puis, sept ans plus tard, le Sun m'a envoyé à la Maison Blanche, une tâche aussi proche du paradis qu'un journaliste pouvait l'être. Cependant, toutes mes réussites ne semblaient insignifiantes à ses yeux. Le succès d'oncle Edwin était vraiment agaçant pendant mes premières années de reporter. Quelle sensation, pensais-je.
Puis, au-delà de mes rêves d'enfant les plus fous, le Times a frappé à ma porte. C'était triste qu'oncle Edwin soit décédé à cette époque. En 1979, j'ai remporté le prix Pulitzer. Malheureusement, le cerveau et la santé de ma mère se sont détériorés l'année précédente, la laissant dans une maison de retraite, coupée du monde pour toujours. Elle n'a jamais su pour mon Pulitzer.

"En 1980, la fille de 13 ans de Candy Lightner, Cad, a été tuée par un conducteur en état d'ébriété alors qu'elle marchait dans une rue de banlieue en Californie. ""Le jour du décès de ma fille, je me suis promis de me battre pour que cet accident inutile serve à quelque chose de positif dans les années à venir"", a écrit Candy Lightner plus tard.
Le conducteur en état d'ébriété a été condamné à deux ans de prison. Cependant, il a évité la prison en purgeant sa peine dans un camp de travail et une maison de transition. Mme Lightner était très en colère à ce sujet et a donc organisé Mothers Against Drunk Drivers (MADD), qui a ensuite changé son nom pour Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Le but de son organisation était de sensibiliser le public à la gravité de la conduite en état d'ébriété et de promouvoir une législation sévère contre ce crime.
Avant que Mme Lightner ne crée MADD, l'intoxication, y compris la conduite en état d'ébriété, n'était pas prise au sérieux. L'intoxication était souvent utilisée comme une excuse pour un comportement autrement inacceptable : ""Je ne savais pas ce que je faisais - j'étais ivre.""
Candy Lightner est apparue dans de grandes émissions de télévision, a pris la parole devant le Congrès américain, s'est adressée à des groupes professionnels et commerciaux, et a travaillé sans relâche pendant des années pour changer les attitudes du public, modifier le comportement judiciaire et promouvoir une nouvelle législation stricte. Mme Lightner a quitté MADD parce que l'organisation qu'elle a elle-même créée change son orientation. ""Je n'ai pas créé MADD pour lutter contre l'alcool. J'ai créé MADD pour lutter contre la conduite en état d'ébriété.""

"Certaines personnes vous mettent à l'aise en leur présence. Vous passez une heure avec elles et vous avez l'impression de les connaître depuis la moitié de votre vie. Ces personnes ont quelque chose en commun. Et une fois que nous savons ce que c'est, nous pouvons essayer de le faire nous-mêmes.
Comment fait-on ? Voici plusieurs compétences que possèdent les bons interlocuteurs. Si vous suivez ces compétences, elles vous aideront à mettre les gens à l'aise et à vous lier d'amitié avec eux rapidement.
Tout d'abord, les bons interlocuteurs posent des questions. Presque tout le monde, aussi timide soit-il, répondra à une question. Une femme d'affaires bien connue dit : ""Lors des déjeuners d'affaires, je demande toujours aux gens ce qu'ils ont fait ce matin. C'est une question courante, mais elle permettra de lancer la conversation."" De là, vous pouvez passer à d'autres sujets, parfois à des questions vraiment personnelles. Et la façon dont il répondra vous indiquera jusqu'où vous pouvez aller.
De plus, une fois que les bons interlocuteurs ont posé des questions, ils écoutent les réponses. Ce point semble clair, mais il ne l'est pas. Vos questions doivent avoir un but et contribuer à vous dire quel type de personne vous avez en face de vous. Et pour le découvrir, vous devez vraiment écouter attentivement et avec intérêt.
Ecouter vraiment signifie au moins certaines choses. Tout d'abord, cela signifie ne pas changer de sujet de conversation. Si quelqu'un s'en tient à un sujet, vous pouvez considérer cela comme un fait qu'il s'y intéresse vraiment. Ecouter vraiment signifie aussi ne pas se contenter d'écouter les mots, mais aussi les tons de la voix. Si la voix semble terne, alors il est temps pour vous de changer de sujet.
Enfin et surtout, les bons interlocuteurs savent bien comment gérer l'occasion du départ. Si vous dites au revoir, vous pouvez lui serrer la main fermement et dire : ""J'ai vraiment apprécié de vous rencontrer."" Si vous souhaitez revoir cette personne, ne le gardez pas secret. Dites aux gens ce que vous ressentez, et ils pourraient s'en aller en ayant l'impression de vous connaître depuis la moitié de leur vie.

"Lorsque les joueurs de la NBA sont jeunes, ils pensent pouvoir gagner le championnat tout seuls. Ce n'est que plus tard, après avoir vieilli et traversé de nombreuses batailles, qu'ils apprennent une leçon importante : il n'y a pas de ""moi"" dans ""équipe"".

Il n'y a pas de meilleur exemple de la valeur du travail d'équipe que les Boston Celtics. Paul Pierce, Ray Allen et Kevin Garnett étaient tous des superstars dans trois équipes différentes. Pourtant, aucun d'eux n'avait de titre à son actif. Puis, la saison dernière, ils ont décidé de sacrifier de l'argent et des statistiques individuelles pour jouer ensemble. Garnett et Allen ont rejoint Pierce chez les Celtics et ont changé la NBA au passage.

Cela a commencé de manière simple. Garnett et Allen sont deux des athlètes les plus intenses au monde. Ils traitent chaque seconde de chaque entraînement comme si c'était le championnat de la NBA. Si vous voulez jouer à leurs côtés, vous devrez faire de même. Ainsi, les jeunes joueurs des Celtics ont commencé à donner leur maximum également.

Pierce était la star des Celtics depuis de nombreuses années. Il avait l'habitude de tirer de nombreux ballons par match. Mais avec l'arrivée d'Allen et de Garnett, il a tiré moins et s'est concentré sur la défense. Son altruisme a montré aux jeunes joueurs que la seule chose qui comptait était de faire ce qui était bon pour l'équipe.

Lorsque les Celtics gagnaient et que le match était presque terminé, Garnett, Pierce et Allen sortaient du jeu. Mais ils ne se contentaient pas de s'asseoir sur le banc. Au lieu de cela, ils se tenaient debout et acclamaient et criaient pour leurs coéquipiers. Ils voulaient soutenir leurs amis et leurs coéquipiers.

Maintenant, les gars qui ne jouent pas savent qu'ils peuvent toujours influencer le jeu en encourageant, alors ils crient et encouragent lorsque Garnett, Allen et Pierce jouent. Les Celtics ont développé une relation forte. Ils sont plus que de simples coéquipiers. Ils sont frères.

Le résultat : les Boston Celtics ont remporté le championnat et sont considérés comme les favoris pour remporter à nouveau le championnat de la Conférence Est cette année.

Il y a un dicton qui dit : ""Une équipe qui réussit bat avec un seul cœur."" Si c'est le cas, les Celtics ont peut-être le plus gros cœur de la NBA.

"Les pires jours de l'été sont les jours de pluie. Nous passons toute l'année à attendre le beau temps et les longues journées chaudes. En hiver, avec ses journées nuageuses et son froid glacial, nous rêvons de ces journées à la plage, allongés sur le sable et profitant du soleil éclatant et brûlant. Et puis l'été arrive, et il pleut.

Enfant, je me réveillais les jours d'été pluvieux et j'étais sur le point de pleurer. Ce n'était pas juste. Nous avons souffert pendant des mois d'école et avons subi le mauvais temps pendant ces dix courtes semaines de liberté.

Ces jours d'été pluvieux, je n'avais rien de divertissant à faire et je ne pouvais que rester à l'intérieur, regardant la pluie comme un oiseau en cage. J'étais enfant unique, donc je n'avais personne avec qui jouer. Mon père travaillait de chez lui, donc je n'étais pas vraiment seule, mais il ne pouvait pas jouer activement avec moi puisqu'il était au travail. C'est ces jours-là que je regardais ce qui passait à la télévision ou que je lisais tous les livres que je pouvais trouver dans les parages. Je priais chaque soir pour que la pluie ne soit pas là le lendemain.

En tant qu'adulte, cependant, mon opinion sur la pluie d'été a changé. Lorsque vous devez travailler tous les jours, l'été n'est pas aussi excitant. Tout semble fade. Un tel état d'esprit vous fait encourager tout ce qui est nouveau ou différent. Je passe l'hiver à rêver de l'été et l'été à rêver de l'hiver. Quand l'été arrive, je déteste la chaleur. Et puis j'attends la pluie, parce que la pluie apporte un front froid, ce qui me met à l'aise. Les jours de pluie restent les pires jours de l'été, mais la pluie d'été aujourd'hui signifie un temps positivement magnifique - et beaucoup plus frais - demain.

"Un poète et un réalisateur de films pourraient avoir plus en commun qu'on ne le pense ! Langston Hughes a commencé à écrire des poèmes au lycée et est rapidement devenu l'un des plus grands écrivains américains. La plupart de ses écrits portent sur ses expériences en tant qu'Afro-américain. Il a écrit des poèmes sur des personnes qui ont travaillé dur toute leur vie mais qui ont quand même trouvé des choses pour lesquelles être heureux. Il a écrit des pièces de théâtre et des livres sur la justice pour tous, et il a également écrit des livres pour enfants. The Sweet and Sour Animal Book est un recueil de ses poèmes animaliers. Des illustrations et des photographies ont été utilisées dans le livre. ""Accroche-toi à tes rêves"" est une ligne d'un célèbre poème de Hughes. C'est exactement ce qu'il a fait tout au long de sa vie.

Quand Steven Spielberg était au collège, il voulait faire un film. Il avait une idée de film, mais pas d'argent. Il a lancé une entreprise de plantation d'arbres et a réalisé son film avec l'argent qu'il a gagné. Spielberg n'a jamais arrêté de faire des films, même après que de nombreuses écoles de cinéma l'aient refusé. Aujourd'hui, il est l'un des réalisateurs les plus populaires et les plus importants au monde. Ses films parlent de personnes aventureuses, courageuses, gentilles. Ses personnages se battent souvent pour ce qui est bon. Certains de ses films parlent de ses origines juives, comme La Liste de Schindler. Spielberg a un jour déclaré : ""Je ne rêve pas beaucoup la nuit parce que je rêve pour vivre.""

"Chicago envisage des mesures fermes pour empêcher le poisson-chat asiatique, un poisson géant originaire d'Extrême-Orient, d'envahir en grand nombre les Grands Lacs d'Amérique du Nord. Une telle initiative pourrait coûter jusqu'à 18 milliards de dollars, un lourd fardeau économique pour la ville.

Cette espèce, mesurant plus d'un mètre de long, a été introduite pour la première fois dans les États du sud des États-Unis il y a trois décennies pour contrôler les mauvaises herbes dans les stations d'épuration. Mais elle s'est échappée dans le Mississippi et a rapidement proliféré, remontant vers les Grands Lacs et menaçant les espèces de poissons indigènes sur son passage.

""Des dizaines d'entre eux sautent souvent hors de l'eau à l'approche des bateaux."" Michael Beecham, un expert environnemental local, a décrit à quel point la scène était effrayante. ""Je suis descendu le long du fleuve et j'ai vu ces poissons sauter et me frapper au visage. C'est un gros problème pour nos espèces indigènes"", a-t-il déclaré.

Une réunion a été organisée pour trouver une solution technologique au problème du poisson-chat, l'une d'entre elles consistant à bloquer certaines parties du système de canaux de Chicago. John Goss, présent à la réunion, s'inquiétait de l'impact que le blocage du système de canaux aurait sur l'industrie. ""Cela augmenterait certainement le coût du transport"", a-t-il déclaré. ""Il est actuellement très bon marché et efficace d'acheminer les matériaux et les produits finis par le canal de navigation de Chicago.""

Une autre option moins coûteuse consiste à manger le poisson jusqu'à ce qu'il disparaisse. Dirk Fucik vend des hamburgers de poisson-chat dans sa poissonnerie non loin du centre-ville de Chicago. Il pense que les poissons-chats constituent une excellente ressource. ""Les attraper et les jeter est un gaspillage"", dit-il. ""Les manger permet de résoudre le problème et crée également des emplois."" Mais l'idée n'a pas encore trouvé son public. Pour l'instant, il est le seul à Chicago à vendre des hamburgers de poisson-chat.

"L'argent nous entoure. Chaque jour, nous le voyons, nous l'utilisons, il est sur le bout de notre langue. Avez-vous déjà réfléchi à l'origine de l'argent que vous transportez tous les jours ?

Créer de l'argent est un travail très particulier et pas une tâche facile. Il faut jusqu'à 65 étapes. Lorsque l'argent en circulation devient sale et usé, il est remplacé par de l'argent neuf. L'ancien argent est retiré des banques et amené dans des endroits où il est détruit. Généralement, l'ancien argent est brûlé. L'argent brûlé est remplacé par de nouveaux billets de banque.

Si l'ancien argent est remplacé, de nouveaux billets sont imprimés dans un endroit appelé une fabrique de monnaie. De grandes feuilles de papier sont imprimées avec de nombreuses images de certaines devises. Ces grandes feuilles sont découpées en billets individuels. Les billets individuels sont ensuite regroupés en grosses piles, puis envoyés aux banques.

Parfois, la fabrique de monnaie crée un nouveau billet avec une nouvelle image (des portraits d'hommes d'État et des lieux d'intérêt sont privilégiés) ou une nouvelle couleur. Il n'est pas facile pour le gouvernement de créer un nouveau billet. Cela prend beaucoup de temps et il y a de nombreuses étapes à franchir avant qu'un nouveau billet puisse être envoyé aux banques. Tout d'abord, les membres du gouvernement décident qu'un nouveau type de billet est nécessaire. Ensuite, ils demandent à un artiste de concevoir le nouveau billet. Un autre artiste découpe la nouvelle image dans un morceau de métal mou appelé un poinçon. Les poinçons sont fabriqués et placés sur de grandes machines à imprimer. Ensuite, du papier très spécial est utilisé, que personne d'autre que la fabrique de monnaie ne peut obtenir. Avec ce papier spécial, la fabrique de monnaie imprime également des devises en utilisant des couleurs spéciales. Une fois que les poinçons ont imprimé les nouvelles devises sur le papier, les billets sont coupés, empilés et envoyés aux banques.

Bien que la science ait longtemps mis en garde contre le fait d'entendre trop de ce que nous, les humains, aimons entendre lorsque nous essayons de comprendre les sons animaux, la musicalité de certains sons commence maintenant à avoir un impact sur la science de la communication animale elle-même.
De nombreux sons animaux spécifiques expriment l'agression, l'avertissement ou la nourriture, mais ces explications pratiques sont difficiles à appliquer aux longs chants. Certains chants de baleines peuvent durer jusqu'à 24 heures. L'explication habituelle pour le chant des oiseaux est que les oiseaux chantent pour attirer des partenaires ou pour annoncer les limites de leur territoire. Mais le public n'est pas toujours évident pour ces longues chansons d'amour, qui présentent de nombreux éléments liés à la musique humaine : rythme, mélodie, thèmes, motifs répétitifs, organisation, variété, intérêt - le tout s'additionnant à quelque chose que les humains trouvent beau depuis des milliers d'années. ""Les oiseaux ont enseigné à l'homme"", écrivait le poète et philosophe romain Lucrèce, ""et lui ont appris les chants avant que son art ne commence"".
Quelle est la valeur scientifique de ces sons ? L'avantage d'entendre de la musique dans la nature et d'essayer de tendre la main à la nature à travers la musique est que, même si nous ne la comprenons pas complètement, elle est si accessible.
La musique refuse l'explication, mais elle exprime clairement quelque chose de profond et d'important, dont les humains ne peuvent pas se passer. Trouver de la musique dans le son des oiseaux, des baleines et d'autres animaux fait paraître les frontières lointaines de la nature beaucoup plus proches de nous.

"De nombreux jeunes Américains gagnent leur propre argent de poche en effectuant des petits boulots pour leurs voisins. Le baby-sitting est l'un des plus courants de ces emplois. La plupart des couples n'ont ni domestiques ni parents vivant avec eux, et ils ont besoin de quelqu'un pour garder les enfants s'ils veulent sortir.

Une autre façon est de tondre la pelouse en été et de dégager la neige des trottoirs et des allées en hiver. Beaucoup de gens tondent leur propre pelouse, mais souvent ils préfèrent confier cette tâche à l'enfant d'un voisin. En hiver, le déneigement des rues et des autoroutes est la responsabilité du gouvernement. Les propriétaires ou les locataires, cependant, doivent dégager les trottoirs et les allées. Étant donné que le déneigement est très fatigant, de nombreuses personnes préfèrent embaucher des adolescents pour ce travail plutôt que de le faire elles-mêmes.

En outre, de nombreux adolescents américains travaillent généralement deux à trois heures après l'école et toute la journée le samedi ou le dimanche au supermarché local. Ils travaillent comme caissiers ou employés d'entrepôt. Ou ils aident les clients à transporter des choses jusqu'à leurs voitures. D'autres emplois préférés sont le service à la table dans les restaurants ou le travail à temps partiel dans les magasins ou les stations-service.

En gagnant leur propre argent de poche, les adolescents acquièrent un sentiment d'indépendance et un sens des responsabilités qui les prépare à une vie productive dans la société.

"Il était une fois, deux bons amis. L'un s'appelait Jack et l'autre s'appelait James. Un jour, les deux amis se promenaient dans le désert. Au cours de leur voyage, ils se sont disputés, et Jack n'a pas pu se contrôler et a frappé James au visage. James s'est senti blessé, mais il n'a rien dit. Au lieu de cela, il a écrit dans le sable : ""Aujourd'hui, mon meilleur ami Jack m'a frappé au visage.""

Ils ont continué à marcher jusqu'à ce qu'ils trouvent une oasis. Ils ont décidé d'y prendre de l'eau. Soudain, James a eu des ennuis dans l'eau, il est tombé dans la vase et était en danger. Jack l'a sauvé immédiatement. Lorsqu'il s'est senti mieux, il a écrit sur une pierre : ""Aujourd'hui, mon meilleur ami Jack m'a sauvé la vie."" Jack a été très surpris et a demandé à James : ""Après que je t'aie blessé, tu as écrit dans le sable et maintenant tu écris sur la pierre. Pourquoi ?"" James a répondu : ""Quand quelqu'un nous blesse, nous devons l'écrire dans le sable afin que le vent du pardon puisse l'emporter. Mais quand quelqu'un fait quelque chose de bien pour nous, nous devons l'écrire sur la pierre, afin qu'aucun vent ne puisse l'emporter.""

Depuis lors, les deux bons amis ne se sont plus jamais disputés et ils se sont mieux entendus.

"  Quelques idées reçues courantes. La beauté n'est que superficielle. Les atouts et les handicaps physiques n'ont pas beaucoup d'importance dans une carrière de direction. Une femme devrait toujours essayer de paraître au mieux de sa forme.
Au cours des 30 dernières années, les sociologues ont mené plus de 1 000 études sur la façon dont nous réagissons aux personnes belles et moins belles. La conclusion quasi unanime : l'apparence compte, plus que la plupart d'entre nous ne le réalisent. Les données suggèrent, par exemple, que les individus physiquement attirants sont plus susceptibles d'être bien traités par leurs parents, recherchés comme amis et courtisés romantiquement. À l'exception peut-être des femmes qui recherchent des emplois de direction, elles sont également plus susceptibles d'être embauchées, bien payées et promues.
Non-américain, dites-vous, injuste et extrêmement incroyable ? Une fois de plus, les scientifiques nous ont surpris en train de proférer des pieux souhaits tout en agissant tout à fait au contraire. Leur expérience type fonctionne un peu comme ceci. Ils donnent à chaque membre d'un groupe - des étudiants, des enseignants ou des responsables du personnel des entreprises, par exemple - un papier relatant les réalisations d'une personne. Une photographie est jointe au papier. Si les papiers disent tous exactement la même chose, les photos sont différentes. Certaines montrent une personne d'une beauté saisissante, d'autres une personne d'apparence moyenne et d'autres un être humain exceptionnellement peu attirant. Les membres du groupe sont invités à évaluer l'individu sur certains attributs, allant de la chaleur personnelle à la probabilité qu'il ou elle soit promu.
Presque invariablement, plus la personne sur la photo est belle, plus elle est bien notée. Pour reprendre l'expression, empruntée à Sappho, que les sociologues utilisent pour résumer la perception commune, ce qui est beau est bon.
Dans le monde des affaires, cependant, la beauté est un atout à double tranchant pour les femmes, et plus encore que pour les hommes. Un professeur de l'université d'État de l'Utah, qui est une autorité en la matière, explique : En termes de carrière, l'impact de l'attractivité physique sur les hommes est modeste. Mais son impact potentiel sur les femmes peut être énorme, facilitant par exemple l'accès des plus belles aux emplois où elles sont sous le feu des projecteurs. D'un autre côté, il existe maintenant suffisamment de littérature pour conclure que les femmes séduisantes qui aspirent à des postes de direction ne s'en sortent pas aussi bien que celles qui sont peut-être moins attrayantes.

"Pendant cinq jours, le parc du centre-ville d'Edmonton se transforme en une immense scène où les artistes peuvent partager leurs talents et où le public peut se divertir et célébrer. Depuis ses débuts en 1980, le festival de musique folk d'Edmonton commémore le véritable sentiment de ce qu'est la musique folk, à savoir la convivialité traditionnelle que l'on ressent lorsque les gens se rassemblent pour partager des histoires et des émotions à travers la chanson.

Cette année marquera la sixième année où la bénévole Riedel offrira son temps au festival. « Les gens qui sortent d'un printemps et d'un été bien remplis ont un moment de détente », a déclaré Riedel. « C'est vraiment facile de se détendre, et c'est génial de voir les familles et les amis s'amuser ensemble. » Ces familles et ces amis viennent de tous les horizons musicaux. Les amateurs de blues sont présents, tout comme les amateurs de bluegrass. Ce festival fait de son mieux pour développer les intérêts musicaux de tous.

Avec tant d'années d'expérience, le festival est devenu une machine bien rodée et fait tout ce qu'il peut pour que les participants se sentent aussi à l'aise que possible. Des stations d'eau gratuites sont disponibles dans tout le site pour permettre aux gens de remplir leurs gobelets de voyage. Lorsque les gens achètent de la nourriture, des assiettes réutilisables sont fournies moyennant des frais de 2 $, mais ces frais sont remboursés lorsque l'assiette est rapportée.

Le festival a été complètement épuisé en termes de billets, et ce, en un temps record. Mais avec des grands noms comme Van Morrison et Jakob Dylan, il est facile de comprendre comment cela s'est produit. Il n'y a pas de parking pendant le festival, il est donc fortement recommandé d'utiliser le système Park & Ride ou les transports en commun d'Edmonton. Un espace de rangement pour vélos est prévu et sera accessible du jeudi au dimanche une heure avant l'ouverture des portes jusqu'à 45 minutes après la fermeture des portes.

Le festival de musique folk d'Edmonton débutera le mercredi 4 août avec Van Morrison qui jouera lors du concert spécial de la collecte de fonds, et se terminera le dimanche 8 août.

"""La Chine compte actuellement 350 millions de fumeurs, soit un tiers du total mondial. Les fumeurs chinois deviennent maintenant dépendants de la nicotine à l'âge de 19 ans, cinq ans plus tôt que l'âge moyen de début de 24 ans en 1997"", a indiqué un rapport il y a quelques années.
Sur les 1,1 milliard de fumeurs dans le monde, plus de 800 millions se trouvent dans les pays en développement. Et en tant que plus grand pays en développement au monde, la Chine a également le plus grand nombre de fumeurs.
Des faits effrayants commencent à apparaître lorsque l'on examine qui sont les fumeurs chinois. Sur les 350 millions de dépendants, plus de 100 millions ont moins de 18 ans, tandis que plus de 50 % des enseignants et des médecins masculins sont fumeurs.
Un taux de dépendants aussi élevé parmi les enseignants et les médecins masculins aura certainement un impact négatif sur la jeune génération.
Les enseignants sont généralement censés être des modèles pour les élèves qui ont tendance à considérer tout ce qu'ils font comme juste et à suivre leur exemple. Il est très probable que le nombre de fumeurs adolescents augmentera dans un avenir proche à moins que des mesures ne soient prises pour interdire aux enseignants de fumer devant leurs élèves ou pour désigner les écoles comme des zones non-fumeurs.
Ce qui est vraiment déconcertant, c'est pourquoi tant de médecins fument. Ils sont conscients des conséquences de cette habitude, comme l'hypertension artérielle et le cancer du poumon. Leur exemple ne fait que justifier la dépendance de tant d'autres.
Si les personnes instruites donnent l'exemple en cessant de fumer au moins dans les lieux publics, il serait beaucoup plus facile de faire passer le message qu'il est incivique de fumer en public.
En Chine, il devrait également y avoir une loi nationale pour interdire de fumer dans les lieux publics. Cela contribuerait massivement à réduire le nombre de personnes en Chine qui fument jusqu'à leur mort prématurée.

"En raison du stress et des tensions de la vie moderne, les gens d'aujourd'hui préfèrent regarder la télévision plutôt que de se réunir avec leurs voisins. Leur comportement ne reflète pas les feuilletons télévisés comme Coronation Street et East Enders. Ashley Peacock et Toyah Battersby de la série ""Coronation Street"" connaissent tous leurs voisins. Mais une enquête de la Poste Royale montre que les moins de 35 ans dans la vraie vie ne songeraient même pas à passer chez le voisin pour une discussion ou pour emprunter une tasse de sucre. Trois personnes sur dix disent qu'elles ne reconnaîtraient pas leurs voisins si elles les croisaient dans la rue. La même proportion n'aiderait leurs voisins que si cela était absolument nécessaire, tandis que 31% ne veulent pas les connaître davantage. Vingt-six pour cent parlent rarement ou jamais à la personne d'à côté. Trente-cinq pour cent ne parlent à leurs voisins qu'occasionnellement, et six pour cent les détestent activement. La génération plus âgée est toujours sociable, avec 70% des plus de 55 ans prenant le temps de discuter avec leurs voisins.

"En mai 2014, des touristes chinois ont découvert un message en caractères chinois ""Ding Jinhao s'est rendu ici"" gravé sur une statue de dieu dans un temple égyptien vieux de 3 500 ans. Un touriste en colère a pris une photo de la gribouille et l'a postée sur les réseaux sociaux Sina Weibo. La photo s'est rapidement répandue et a généré plus de 100 000 commentaires en deux semaines. Plus tard, un garçon chinois de 15 ans a été identifié comme étant l'auteur de cette inscription. De nombreux internautes ont exprimé leur colère et leur déception face à ce comportement incivique. Ils ont recherché et identifié le garçon, puis ont publié ses informations personnelles, y compris son adresse et des photos en ligne.

Au cours du week-end, le site web de son école a été piraté et des journalistes ont afflué à son domicile dans la ville de Nankin. Assiégée par les journalistes, la mère de l'enfant a présenté des excuses officielles pour le comportement de son fils. ""Nous voulons nous excuser auprès du peuple égyptien et des personnes qui ont suivi cette affaire en Chine"", a déclaré la mère du garçon au journal local.

Avec l'essor économique de la Chine au cours des dernières décennies, un nombre croissant de ses résidents sont devenus des touristes mondiaux. Au début du mois, le vice-Premier ministre chinois Wang Yang a déclaré : ""Le comportement incivique de certains touristes donne une mauvaise réputation à ce pays à l'étranger."" La discussion sur la qualité chinoise s'est poursuivie dans de nombreux médias.

Sur une note positive, le gouvernement égyptien a décrit les dommages au temple comme superficiels et pouvant être restaurés, et a annoncé qu'il pardonnerait au garçon.

"La réputation de l'octopus en tant que tueur d'hommes n'est pas simplement une exagération - c'est un mythe total. L'octopus peut en effet être un chasseur mortel, mais seulement pour ses victimes naturelles. Certains crustacés et un poisson malade ou imprudent occasionnel ont des raisons de craindre ce chasseur aux multiples bras, mais une personne est beaucoup trop grosse pour intéresser même le plus grand des poulpes. Même le plus grand des poulpes est beaucoup plus petit que ce que la plupart des gens imaginent. Loin d'être assez grand pour avaler un navire, comme les poulpes monstrueux des films ont pu le faire, le plus grand octopus, que l'on trouve sur la côte Pacifique, pèse environ 110 livres et ne dépasse pas dix pieds de large.
Le bec dur et semblable à celui d'un perroquet d'un octopus n'est pas utilisé pour attaquer les plongeurs en eaux profondes, mais pour ouvrir les coquillages. En effet, l'octopus possède une gorge si petite qu'il ne peut pas avaler de gros morceaux de viande. Au lieu de cela, il se nourrit en versant des sucs digestifs sur ses victimes, puis en aspirant les restes en soupes.

"Tu Youyou, avec William Campbell et Satoshi Omura, a remporté le prix Nobel 2015 pour ses travaux contre les maladies parasitaires. Campbell, d'origine irlandaise, et Omura, japonais, ont remporté la moitié du prix pour la découverte d'un nouveau médicament, l'avermectine, qui a contribué à la lutte contre la cécité des rivières et la filariose lymphatique, tout en démontrant son efficacité contre d'autres maladies parasitaires. La scientifique chinoise Tu Youyou, une femme de 85 ans, s'est vu attribuer l'autre moitié du prix pour la découverte de l'artémisinine, un médicament qui guérit le paludisme et a sauvé des millions de vies dans le monde entier, en particulier dans les pays en développement.

Lorsque la nouvelle de la victoire de Tu au prix Nobel a été annoncée, il y a eu des acclamations, mais aussi des doutes. Cela a également mis en lumière les différences de pratiques d'attribution des prix entre la Chine et l'Occident. Certains ont dit que cette réussite était le résultat des efforts collectifs de nombreux scientifiques chinois, et qu'il était injuste d'attribuer le prix uniquement à Tu. En effet, les prix scientifiques chinois sont principalement décernés à des projets plutôt qu'à des scientifiques individuels. Mais les prix occidentaux ont tendance à honorer les scientifiques individuels qui sont les premiers à proposer une nouvelle idée ou une nouvelle méthode. Li Zhenzhen, chercheuse à l'Académie chinoise des sciences, a déclaré que l'Occident croit que les progrès scientifiques proviennent de l'esprit créatif des individus.

En 1969, Tu a commencé à diriger un projet gouvernemental visant à éradiquer le paludisme. Tu et ses collègues ont expérimenté 380 extraits dans 2 000 recettes candidates avant de réussir à obtenir la substance pure qinghaosu, plus tard connue sous le nom d'artémisinine. En 2011, Tu a reçu le prix Lasker Debakey de recherche clinique médicale, souvent appelé ""le prix Nobel américain"".

"Les rayons X classiques peuvent montrer beaucoup de choses. Les scanners peuvent montrer encore plus. Ils peuvent donner une vue complète des organes du corps. 

Qu'est-ce qu'un scanner ? Scanner est l'abréviation d'un type de machine. Il s'agit d'un appareil de radiographie spécial qui prend une image à 360 degrés d'une petite zone du corps d'un patient.

Les médecins utilisent les rayons X pour étudier et déterminer les maladies et les blessures à l'intérieur du corps. Les rayons X peuvent trouver un objet étranger à l'intérieur du corps ou prendre des images de certains organes internes pour être radiographiés.

Cependant, un scanner utilise un groupe de rayons X pour donner une vue en coupe transversale d'une partie spécifique du corps. Un groupe précis de rayons X est balayé à travers le corps et autour du patient dans de nombreuses directions différentes. Un ordinateur étudie les informations provenant de chaque direction et produit une image en coupe transversale claire sur un écran. Cette image est ensuite photographiée pour une utilisation ultérieure. Plusieurs coupes transversales, prises l'une après l'autre, peuvent donner des ""photos"" claires de l'ensemble du corps ou de tout organe. Les scanners les plus récents peuvent même donner des images claires d'organes actifs et en mouvement, tout comme une caméra à grande vitesse peut ""arrêter l'action"", donnant des images claires de ce qui apparaît flou à l'œil. Et grâce aux images à 360 degrés, les scanners donnent des vues claires et complètes des organes, ce qui ne pouvait autrefois être obtenu que pendant une opération ou un examen d'un patient décédé.

Une exposition fréquente aux rayons X peut provoquer des brûlures cutanées, le cancer ou d'autres dommages à l'organisme. Pourtant, les scanners n'exposent pas le patient à plus de radiations que les rayons X classiques. Les scanners peuvent également être réalisés sans injecter une substance nocive au patient, ils sont donc moins risqués que les rayons X classiques.

Les scanners fournissent des informations exactes et détaillées. Ils peuvent rapidement détecter des saignements intracrâniens, par exemple. Ils contribuent à sauver des vies.

"Commençons par dire ce qui ne cause pas nos rêves. Nos rêves ne proviennent pas ""d'un autre monde"". Ils ne sont pas des messages d'une source extérieure. Ils ne sont pas non plus un aperçu du futur.

Tous nos rêves ont un lien avec nos sentiments, nos peurs, nos aspirations, nos souhaits, nos besoins et nos souvenirs. Si une personne a faim, est fatiguée ou a froid, ses rêves peuvent inclure une sensation de ce type. Si les couvertures sur votre corps, comme une couette ou une couverture, ont glissé de votre lit, vous pouvez rêver que vous dormez sur la glace et la neige. Le matériau du rêve que vous ferez ce soir est susceptible de provenir de l'expérience que vous vivez aujourd'hui.

Ainsi, le sujet de votre rêve provient généralement de quelque chose qui vous affecte pendant votre sommeil (sensation de froid, bruit, inconfort, etc.) et il peut également utiliser vos expériences passées, ainsi que les désirs et les intérêts que vous avez actuellement. C'est pourquoi les enfants sont susceptibles de rêver de fées, les enfants plus âgés d'examens scolaires, les personnes affamées de nourriture, les soldats nostalgiques de leur famille et les prisonniers de liberté.

Pour vous montrer comment cela se produit pendant votre sommeil et comment vos besoins et vos désirs peuvent tous être réunis dans un rêve, voici l'histoire de l'expérience. Un homme était endormi et le dos de sa main était frotté avec un morceau de coton absorbé. Il rêvait qu'il était à l'hôpital et que sa charmante petite amie lui rendait visite, assise sur le lit et lui caressant doucement les mains !

Certains scientifiques ont fait une étude spéciale sur les raisons pour lesquelles nous rêvons, ce que nous rêvons et ce que ces rêves signifient. Leurs explications des rêves, bien qu'un peu raisonnables, ne sont pas acceptées par tous, mais elles offrent une approche intéressante du problème. Ils pensent que les rêves sont principalement des expressions de désirs qui ne se réalisent pas. En d'autres termes, les rêves sont un moyen de réaliser vos désirs.

"""Cher Grand-père Guo, nous perdons notre enfance ! S'il vous plaît, aidez-nous !"" 
Guo Chuanjie, un scientifique célèbre, a reçu une lettre d'un élève d'école primaire de Pékin. L'élève a déclaré que de nombreux enfants chinois doivent suivre des cours supplémentaires le week-end afin d'intégrer des collèges réputés. L'enfant espérait que plus de personnes entendraient sa voix avec l'aide de Guo. 
Guo est membre de la Conférence consultative politique du peuple chinois (CCPPC). Le mois dernier, les membres de la CCPPC se sont réunis à Pékin. Ils viennent de tous les horizons - scientifiques, hommes d'affaires, médecins, artistes et athlètes. Ils soumettent des propositions sur les questions importantes du pays pour améliorer notre pays. Concernant la lettre de l'élève de Pékin, Guo l'a lue devant Yuan Guiren, le ministre chinois de l'Éducation, lors d'une réunion de la CCPPC. 
Selon Xinhua, il y avait 5 762 propositions au total. Beaucoup de propositions concernaient des problèmes tels que les prix du logement, la circulation dense et la sécurité alimentaire, qui étaient liés à la vie quotidienne des gens. Certaines propositions portaient sur les adolescents. Par exemple, la chanteuse Han Hong a suggéré que le gouvernement devrait s'occuper des personnes qui trafiquent des enfants. 
Comme d'habitude, les propositions seront transmises aux départements compétents après les réunions. Par exemple, la proposition de Guo a été remise au ministère de l'Éducation. Les départements examineront attentivement les propositions et verront si elles peuvent être mises en œuvre à l'avenir.

"De nos jours, il y a beaucoup de débats sur l'éducation en milieu séparé, car elle a recommencé à gagner en popularité récemment. Selon des études à long terme sur des enfants du monde entier, les élèves réussissent davantage et apprennent mieux dans des écoles de sexe unique.

Une étude australienne portant sur 270 000 élèves a révélé que les garçons et les filles obtenaient de bien meilleurs résultats aux tests standardisés lorsqu'ils fréquentaient des écoles séparées. Lors d'une expérience menée en Virginie en 1995, 100 élèves de huitième année ont été séparés uniquement pour les cours de mathématiques et de sciences. Presque immédiatement, les filles ont commencé à réussir davantage, à gagner en confiance et à participer plus souvent aux activités en classe.

En 2001, une étude britannique a conclu que presque toutes les filles, quelle que soit leur capacité ou leur statut socio-économique, obtenaient de meilleurs résultats dans des classes de sexe unique que dans des classes mixtes. L'étude portant sur 2 954 lycées et 979 écoles primaires a montré que si les garçons des niveaux les plus bas en étude se sont améliorés le plus dans les écoles de sexe unique, l'éducation en milieu séparé a été particulièrement bénéfique pour les filles. Chacune des 50 meilleures écoles primaires privées et des 20 meilleurs lycées privés de Grande-Bretagne sont des écoles de sexe unique.

Les filles ont gagné en confiance en elles en tant qu'étudiantes et ont obtenu de meilleurs résultats à leurs examens du College Board et Advanced Placement. Un quart des femmes membres du Congrès américain et un tiers de toutes les femmes membres des conseils d'administration des 100 plus grandes entreprises américaines sont diplômées de collèges réservés aux femmes.

Si les statistiques ne sont pas aussi dramatiques pour les garçons, ceux-ci ont tendance à adoucir leur esprit compétitif et à devenir plus coopératifs dans un environnement de sexe unique. Ils peuvent simplement être des garçons et ne pas se soucier de ce que les filles pourraient penser.

L'éducation en milieu séparé a un agréable moyen d'encourager les enfants à être sans peur, à être curieux, à être enthousiastes - en bref, à être eux-mêmes. Les enfants sont soumis à des pressions de tous les côtés pour devenir des adultes avant qu'ils ne soient prêts à le faire. Ils grandissent trop vite. Pourquoi ne pas les laisser être des enfants pendant quelques années de plus ? L'éducation en milieu séparé, avec son atmosphère sociale plus douce et plus contrôlée, est la bonne solution pour beaucoup d'enfants.

"Les Futures Étoiles

**Introduction générale**
Les Futures Étoiles a été créé en 1988 en tant que centre de services à but non lucratif pour le développement de l'enfant, dédié à fournir des services de garde d'enfants de qualité dans un environnement éducatif et aimant pour les enfants de 6 semaines à 6 ans. Nos fonds proviennent principalement de dons publics.

Une saine curiosité pour l'apprentissage est la qualité la plus importante pour le développement de la petite enfance. Nous visons à offrir des activités de haute qualité adaptées au développement des jeunes enfants, la période la plus importante du développement de l'enfant, afin qu'ils puissent mieux réussir après le début de leur scolarité formelle.

**Heures d'ouverture**
La garde d'enfants sera assurée pour l'enfant de 7h00 à 18h00 du lundi au vendredi, sauf les jours fériés. Les enfants ne peuvent pas arriver avant 7h00 ni rester après 18h00. En cas d'urgence, le parent doit nous en informer immédiatement en tenant compte de nos arrangements de travail. Des frais de retard de 1,00 $ par minute seront facturés si l'enfant n'est pas récupéré avant 18h05. Les frais de ces services doivent être payés directement au membre du personnel qui s'est occupé de votre enfant jusqu'à votre arrivée, et non au centre. Le défaut de payer les frais de retard peut affecter la poursuite des services avec le centre.

**Frais de scolarité**
Une fois que la disponibilité d'une place pour votre enfant est confirmée, vous devez payer des frais d'inscription de 200 $ par enfant.

Les frais de scolarité hebdomadaires sont de 98,00 $. Vous pouvez effectuer les paiements par carte de crédit ou en espèces tous les lundis. Si votre paiement n'est pas effectué avant 9h00 le mardi, des frais de retard de 25,00 $ vous seront facturés.

"Elles portent les dernières tendances avec les accessoires les plus modernes. Pourtant, il ne s'agit pas de filles dans leur adolescence ou leur vingtaine, mais de femmes dans la soixantaine et la soixantaine. Une génération qui autrefois ne portait que des vêtements démodés favorise désormais les mêmes looks de la rue que ceux portés par celles qui ont leur moitié d'âge.

La professeure Julia Twigg, experte en politique sociale, a déclaré : « Les femmes de plus de 75 ans achètent désormais des vêtements plus fréquemment qu'elles ne le faisaient lorsqu'elles étaient jeunes dans les années 1960. Dans les années 1960, acheter un manteau pour une femme était une affaire sérieuse. C'était un article coûteux qu'elles n'achetaient que tous les trois ou quatre ans - maintenant, vous pouvez en acheter un au supermarché quand vous le souhaitez. La mode est beaucoup moins chère et les gens se lassent des choses plus rapidement. »

La professeure Twigg a analysé les données de dépenses familiales et a constaté que, si le pourcentage des dépenses consacrées aux vêtements et aux chaussures par les femmes était resté à peu près le même - environ 5 ou 6 % des dépenses - le nombre de vêtements achetés avait fortement augmenté.

La professeure a déclaré : « Les vêtements sont maintenant 70 % moins chers qu'ils ne l'étaient dans les années 1960 en raison de l'énorme expansion de la production en Extrême-Orient. Dans les années 1960, Leeds était le cœur de l'industrie de la mode britannique et c'est de là que provenait la plupart des vêtements, mais maintenant presque tous nos vêtements proviennent d'ailleurs. Tout le monde achète plus de vêtements, mais en général, nous ne dépensons pas plus d'argent pour eux. »

La créatrice de mode Angela Barnard, qui dirige sa propre entreprise de mode à Londres, a déclaré que les femmes plus âgées étaient beaucoup plus affectées par le style des célébrités que par le passé.

Elle a déclaré : « Lorsque les gens voient des stars comme Judi Dench et Helen Mirren paraître attirantes et à la mode dans leur soixantaine, elles veulent les suivre. Les femmes plus âgées sont beaucoup plus conscientes des célébrités. Il y a aussi l'essor des émissions de télévision qui montrent aux gens comment ils peuvent changer leur look, et beaucoup de mes clientes plus âgées font du yoga pour rester en forme dans la cinquantaine. Lorsque j'ai commencé mon entreprise il y a quelques années, mes clientes plus âgées avaient tendance à être très riches, mais maintenant ce sont ce que j'appellerais des femmes ordinaires. Ma propre mère a 61 ans et elle porte les dernières tendances d'une manière qu'elle n'aurait jamais fait il y a dix ans. »

"L'annonce de l'interdiction des séries et films de voyage dans le temps par la Chine a suscité beaucoup d'attention sur Internet. Pourtant, le voyage dans le temps en Chine diffère un peu de la notion commune. Il s'éloigne complètement de la science-fiction et se déroule toujours dans le passé. L'imagination est limitée : pas de boucles infinies qui bouleversent le présent et le futur, pas de technologie avancée, pas de nouveaux ordres sociaux ou de nouvelles formes humaines du XXIe siècle, tout est un fait historique connu lorsque l'on voyage dans le temps en Chine.

On ne parle même pas de voyage dans le temps ; les Chinois préfèrent parler de « crossover temporel ». Le crossover temporel est un thème extrêmement populaire pour les romans en ligne depuis des années (il fait en réalité partie intégrante de la culture en ligne chinoise), et n'a été repris par la télévision et le grand écran que ces deux dernières années. La plupart des séries et films de voyage dans le temps sont adaptés de romans en ligne populaires et, comme dans d'autres cas, les adaptations ne sont jamais meilleures que les livres originaux.

L'intrigue principale des romans ou des séries télévisées de voyage dans le temps peut se résumer en une phrase : passer de personne à quelqu'un. Le voyage dans le temps en Chine vise davantage à échapper à la réalité qu'à réaliser des rêves fous.

En Chine, il n'est pas non plus nécessaire d'avoir une machine à voyager dans le temps. Les gens voyagent dans le passé en étant en possession d'antiquités, en se rendant dans des lieux historiques d'intérêt, en étant confrontés à des accidents mortels ou tout simplement en regardant dans un miroir. Certains romans de voyage dans le temps commencent même par : « J'avais tellement envie de retourner dans l'histoire que, un matin, en ouvrant les yeux, j'y étais ». La technologie n'est pas du tout pertinente.

Bien que la Chine ne manque pas d'histoire où retourner, les gens ont leurs propres préférences, et il s'agit en grande partie d'une question de genre. Si le personnage principal est un homme, il retourne généralement à des époques particulières de l'histoire où il peut contribuer à la construction ou à la destruction d'une dynastie. Un exemple typique est « Un pas dans le passé », la première série télévisée de voyage dans le temps en Chine, qui raconte l'histoire d'un membre des forces spéciales qui aide à unifier la Chine et à bâtir la dynastie Qin.

D'autre part, les personnages féminins retournent principalement à la dynastie Qing, en partie parce que la dynastie Qing compte le plus grand nombre de princes avec lesquels tomber amoureux. L'empereur Yongzheng est le favori. Comme on peut le voir dans « Startling by Each Step », un classique du crossover temporel Qing, une fille retourne à la dynastie Qing et tombe amoureuse de l'empereur Yongzheng et de ses frères.

"La science morale est enseignée comme une matière dans la plupart des écoles, mais avec peu d'effet. Peut-être que le problème réside en partie dans le fait que la morale n'est pas une science, à proprement parler. C'est trop un phénomène social, et elle comporte aussi trop d'éléments personnels et subjectifs. De plus, la morale elle-même change avec les générations. Il est donc impossible de la définir dans un manuel.

Je me souviens d'avoir suivi quarante minutes de cours de morale, qui racontaient des histoires de petits enfants qui ne disaient jamais de mensonges et étaient récompensés pour leur bonté. Cela n'a eu aucun effet et ne m'a laissé aucune impression.

Si la science morale doit être enseignée comme une matière dans les écoles, il faut une approche participative. Quand on parle de morale à un enfant, il faut aussi tenir compte des normes sociales et des différences culturelles. Il faut lui expliquer que la morale peut être subjective, et qu'elle peut coexister dans la société. Il faudra probablement se référer à la morale du temps présent.

La meilleure façon d'apprendre à un enfant à vivre, c'est de lui montrer ce qui est valorisé. Si un enfant aime son ami, il faut l'amener à réfléchir aux raisons de son affection. Une fois que l'enfant remarque et reconnaît la bonté chez les autres, il est susceptible de la développer également.

En fait, les enfants apprennent la plupart de leurs principes moraux en observant les personnes qui les entourent. Ils absorbent les schémas comportementaux des enseignants et des élèves plus âgés. Ils observent ce qui est récompensé et qui est puni. Ils apprennent sur le terrain de sport et grâce au travail social. Les cours de science morale devraient simplement consister à les laisser vivre et interagir, et à les voir soutenir les valeurs correctes et récompenser les bons comportements.

"Ma mère a des yeux dans le dos. Elle m'a aussi appris dès mon plus jeune âge à me méfier des hommes étranges, surtout lorsqu'ils vous font des cadeaux. Un jour, un ""gentil homme"" portant des fleurs a réussi à lui voler 20 euros de son sac à main, alors qu'elle le tenait entre ses mains. ""Il a dit qu'il faisait une collecte pour une association caritative de l'église, alors j'ai sorti un euro"", explique-t-elle. ""Il a dit 'non, non, c'est trop', et s'est proposé de regarder dans mon sac à main pour trouver une pièce plus petite. Il doit avoir fait glisser le billet de 20 euros en même temps. Je ne l'ai même pas remarqué avant une heure plus tard. Je me suis sentie tellement bête.""

Selon les neuroscientifiques, la condition essentielle pour réussir un vol à la tire n'est pas d'avoir des doigts habiles, mais de connaître les failles de notre cerveau. La plus importante de ces failles est le fait que notre cerveau n'est pas conçu pour effectuer plusieurs tâches en même temps. La plupart du temps, c'est une bonne chose car cela nous permet de filtrer tous les éléments, sauf les plus importants du monde qui nous entoure. Mais un bon escroc peut l'utiliser à votre encontre. Ce type de ruse implique de capter toute l'attention de quelqu'un avec d'autres mouvements. Les pickpockets de rue utilisent souvent cet effet à leur avantage en créant une situation qui ne peut que surcharger votre système d'attention. D'autres stratégies sont plus psychologiques. Les pickpockets ont tendance à accrocher des pancartes ""Attention aux pickpockets"" car la première chose que les gens font lorsqu'ils les lisent est de vérifier s'ils ont encore leurs objets de valeur, ce qui permet de savoir où ils se trouvent. Et dans le cas de ma mère, le meilleur tour du voleur n'était pas de paraître comme un pickpocket. ""C'était un type très gentil et très sûr de lui. Pas quelqu'un qui vous ferait suspecter"", dit-elle. Apollo Robbins, un pickpocket de scène, a déclaré que les mouvements intelligents, comme le fait de déplacer sa main en arc de cercle plutôt qu'en ligne droite, sont une autre stratégie populaire employée par les escrocs.

Enfin, il faut noter que la plupart des vols sont opportunistes. Le niveau de compétence de la plupart des voleurs est bien inférieur à ce que vous pensez. Mais ils sont suffisamment opportunistes pour suivre l'évolution de la technologie.

"Dans de nombreux pays aujourd'hui, des lois protègent la faune. En Inde, la nécessité d'une telle protection a été reconnue il y a des siècles. 
Vers 300 avant J.-C., un écrivain indien décrivait des forêts qui ressemblaient un peu aux parcs nationaux d'aujourd'hui. Le massacre des animaux sauvages était soigneusement réglementé. Certaines espèces étaient entièrement protégées. À l'intérieur de la forêt, il était interdit de couper des arbres, de brûler du bois ou de piéger des animaux pour leur fourrure. Les animaux qui devenaient dangereux pour les visiteurs humains étaient piégés ou tués à l'extérieur du parc, afin que les autres animaux ne soient pas inquiétés.
Le besoin de protection de la faune est plus grand que jamais aujourd'hui. Environ un millier d'espèces animales sont en danger d'extinction, et la vitesse à laquelle elles sont détruites ne cesse d'augmenter. Chez les mammifères, par exemple, la vitesse d'extinction est maintenant d'environ une espèce par an ; de 1 à 1800 après J.-C., elle était d'environ une espèce tous les cinquante ans. Partout dans le monde, les hommes essaient de résoudre le problème de la sauvegarde de la faune tout en prenant soin de la population mondiale croissante.

Depuis qu'il avait intégré la première année, il détestait l'école. Que se passait-il ? S'il détestait autant l'école maintenant, à quel point cela serait-il pire plus tard ? Tous les enfants se plaignent parfois de l'école. Mais 5 à 10 % des enfants la détestent tellement qu'ils ne veulent pas y aller.

Dans le sillage du tremblement de terre, les habitants de Gwadar, près de la côte sud-ouest, ont commencé à voir un spectacle étrange. Ils ont regardé vers la mer d'Arabie et ont aperçu une forme montagneuse qui émergeait de l'eau. ""J'ai pu voir ce corps gris en forme de dôme au loin, comme une baleine géante"", a déclaré Bahram Baloch, un journaliste local, à la BBC. ""Des centaines de personnes s'étaient rassemblées pour l'observer avec incrédulité.""

Alors, que s'est-il passé ? Le tremblement de terre a atteint une magnitude de 7,7. La force était si puissante qu'elle a déplacé le fond marin, libérant du gaz. Ce gaz a poussé le fond marin, composé principalement de roche et de sable, vers le haut et hors de l'eau. C'est ainsi que se forment les volcans de boue. L'île, qui mesure environ 20 mètres de haut, 30 mètres de long et 90 mètres de large, n'est en réalité que la pointe du volcan de boue.

Est-ce sûr ? Bien que des personnes se soient rendues sur cette nouvelle île, les scientifiques ont détecté la présence de gaz dangereux émanant de l'île nouvellement formée. ""Notre équipe a constaté des bulles remontant à la surface de l'île, qui ont pris feu lorsqu'une allumette a été allumée"", a déclaré Mohammad Danish, un scientifique, à Universe Today.

Ces volcans de boue ne sont pas rares. Mais il est frappant que celui-ci ait émergé dans une zone peuplée, et non loin au large. Cependant, il ne devrait pas durer très longtemps. La plupart de ces volcans de boue sont engloutis sous la mer dans un délai d'un an.

"La vie quotidienne peut être rendue plus heureuse. C'est une question de choix. C'est notre attitude qui nous fait nous sentir heureux ou malheureux. Il est vrai que nous rencontrons toutes sortes de situations au cours de la journée, et certaines d'entre elles peuvent ne pas être propices au bonheur. Nous pouvons choisir de refuser de penser aux événements malheureux. Si nous laissons les événements extérieurs influencer nos humeurs, nous devenons leurs esclaves. D'un autre côté, nous pouvons nous libérer des influences extérieures. Nous pouvons choisir d'être heureux, et nous pouvons faire beaucoup de choses pour ajouter du bonheur à nos vies.

Qu'est-ce que le bonheur ? C'est un sentiment de paix intérieure et de satisfaction. Il est généralement ressenti lorsqu'il n'y a pas d'inquiétudes, de peurs ou de pensées confuses, et cela arrive généralement lorsque nous faisons quelque chose que nous aimons faire ou lorsque nous gagnons, obtenons ou réalisons quelque chose que nous valorisons. Il semble être le résultat d'événements positifs, mais il vient en réalité de l'intérieur, déclenché par des événements extérieurs.

Pour la plupart des gens, le bonheur semble passer rapidement. L'une des meilleures façons de le conserver est d'acquérir la paix intérieure par la méditation quotidienne. Au fur et à mesure que l'esprit devient plus paisible, il devient plus facile de choisir l'habitude du bonheur.

Voici quelques conseils pour accroître le bonheur dans la vie quotidienne :

Efforcez-vous de changer votre façon de voir les choses. Regardez toujours le bon côté des choses.

Pensez à des solutions, pas à des problèmes.

Écoutez de la musique relaxante et stimulante.

Regardez des comédies drôles qui vous font rire.

Chaque jour, consacrez du temps à lire quelques pages d'un livre ou d'un article inspirant.

Chaque fois que vous vous surprenez à penser des pensées négatives, commencez à penser à des choses agréables.

"Votre smartphone peut faire beaucoup de choses. Il peut appeler des gens. Il se connecte à Internet. Il vous permet de jouer à des jeux amusants. Mais il y a un revers à ce petit appareil intelligent : il peut aussi propager des maladies.

""Les gens sont tout aussi susceptibles de tomber malades à cause de leur téléphone que des poignées de salle de bain"", a déclaré Jeffrey Cain, président de l'American Academy of Family Physicians, au Wall Street Journal.

Cela peut être difficile à croire, mais les scientifiques sont arrivés à cette conclusion après avoir testé huit téléphones portables d'un bureau à Chicago. Tous les téléphones testés présentaient un nombre élevé de coliformes, un type de bactérie présent dans les déchets humains, avec environ 2 700 à 4 200 unités de la bactérie sur chaque téléphone. Les bactéries peuvent causer la grippe, la conjonctivite et d'autres maladies. C'est bien ça : votre téléphone est couvert de nos déchets humains.

Bien que les ordinateurs, les clés et les stylos transportent des germes, nos téléphones sont bien plus sales. Ils touchent beaucoup de choses, y compris nos mains et l'intérieur de notre poche ou de notre sac à main. On les emmène presque partout : le bus, le métro, et qui n'a jamais joué à Angry Birds ou Fruit Ninja en étant assis sur les toilettes ?

""Certaines choses que nous pensons être personnelles sont en réalité plus publiques que nous ne l'imaginons"", a déclaré Cain. Ce qui est encore pire, c'est qu'après que le téléphone est revenu de son voyage sale, il passe ensuite la plupart de son temps blotti contre notre visage. Vous ne pensez pas à la fréquence à laquelle vous touchez votre téléphone à votre visage, n'est-ce pas ? Notre nez, notre bouche et nos oreilles sont tous chauds et riches en graisse, un environnement que les germes adorent.

Alors, comment nettoyer votre téléphone ? L'alcool est efficace lorsqu'il est utilisé pour tuer les germes à l'arrière et sur les côtés de votre téléphone. Mais il peut endommager l'écran. Il existe une façon simple et fiable de réduire les germes sur la surface de votre téléphone : lavez-vous les mains régulièrement.

"Martin Lynch, un homme d'affaires américain, passait ses vacances dans un petit village de pêcheurs mexicain depuis plusieurs années. Un matin, alors qu'il se promenait sur la plage, il a vu son ami Pablo Perez, un pêcheur local. Martin a regardé Pablo _ son bateau et emballer le poisson dans une boîte.
Martin a remarqué que Pablo souriait et avait l'air très heureux. Il pouvait également voir plusieurs gros poissons dans le bateau. Martin a salué Pablo et lui a demandé combien de temps il avait fallu pour pêcher les poissons. ""Juste quelques heures"", a répondu Pablo. Martin a demandé : ""Pourquoi n'es-tu pas resté plus longtemps pour pêcher plus de poissons ?"" ""J'en ai assez pour ma famille"", a dit Pablo. ""Et que fais-tu le reste de ta journée ?"" a demandé Martin. ""Je fais la sieste, je joue avec mes enfants, je passe du temps avec ma femme et je vais au village voir mes amis et jouer aux cartes, j'ai une vie pleine et bien remplie."" Martin a expliqué que si Pablo travaillait plus longtemps et pêchait plus de poissons, il pourrait gagner plus d'argent. Avec cet argent supplémentaire, Pablo pourrait acheter plus de bateaux et pêcher plus de poissons. En vendant le poisson, Pablo pourrait ouvrir sa propre usine et vendre directement aux supermarchés.
""Et ensuite ?"" a demandé Pablo. ""Eh bien, vous devriez probablement déménager à Mexico pour gérer l'entreprise. Finalement, vous seriez en mesure de vendre votre entreprise et de gagner des millions de dollars"", a répondu Martin. ""Combien de temps cela va-t-il prendre ?"" a demandé Pablo.
Martin a réfléchi un instant et a dit que cela prendrait probablement au moins 15 ans.
""Et ensuite ?"" a demandé Pablo.

"Le président américain Barack Obama a déclaré vendredi qu'il pouvait plaider en faveur d'un second mandat et que les électeurs finiraient par le voir comme le candidat le mieux préparé à exercer la fonction de président d'ici les élections de l'année prochaine, selon une interview qu'il a accordée aux médias américains.

Dans une interview qu'il a accordée à l'Associated Press, Obama a admis que l'état de l'économie pourrait être son plus grand obstacle à sa réélection.

« Je pense que l'économie va continuer à s'améliorer, et je pense que je serai en mesure de plaider efficacement en faveur de... [le fait] que je suis la personne la mieux préparée pour mener à bien cette tâche afin que nous soyons sur la bonne voie pour réussir au 21e siècle. » a déclaré Obama dans l'interview vidéo réalisée à Chicago, où il avait assisté à des événements de levée de fonds la veille.

« Je pense que je peux plaider en faveur de cela, et je pense que, dans les débats qui auront lieu au cours des 18 prochains mois, le peuple américain sentira que je mérite un second mandat », a-t-il déclaré.

Il a annoncé sa candidature à la réélection le 4 avril. Selon un sondage publié vendredi, seulement 41 % des personnes le soutiennent, un chiffre inférieur à celui de son concurrent. Quelqu'un a déclaré que ce chiffre était influencé par le mécontentement économique.

"Avez-vous déjà suivi des cours de musique contre votre gré ? Peut-être vous êtes-vous plaint à l'époque, car vous pensiez que cela vous privait de temps de jeu. Mais aujourd'hui, vous devriez remercier vos parents pour le temps et l'argent qu'ils ont consacré à votre formation musicale. Une étude récente suggère que les cours de musique peuvent aider les enfants à avoir une meilleure mémoire que leurs pairs.

L'étude canadienne a montré qu'après un an de formation musicale, les enfants ont obtenu de meilleurs résultats à un test de mémoire que ceux qui n'ont pas suivi de cours de musique.

Les chercheurs ont divisé les enfants âgés de 4 à 6 ans en deux groupes : un groupe d'enfants a suivi des cours de musique en dehors de l'école, et l'autre n'a suivi aucune formation musicale. En un an, ils ont passé quatre tests à différents moments. Les résultats ont montré des changements dans le développement du cerveau au moins tous les quatre mois.

Les enfants qui ont suivi des cours de musique ont non seulement obtenu de meilleurs résultats à l'écoute musicale, mais ont également progressé plus rapidement dans d'autres domaines, comme la lecture, l'écriture, les mathématiques et le QI.

"Des dizaines de dauphins ont nagé hors des eaux polluées du port de Haïfa mardi. C'était la première fois que des dauphins visitaient ce port méditerranéen bondé, et les chercheurs ont été surpris et ravis par cet événement inattendu.
Entre 40 et 50 dauphins sont apparus dans le port animé mardi matin, attirés par les eaux riches en poissons du port de Haïfa.
Cependant, la baie est également pleine de produits chimiques nocifs. Aviad Sheinin, professeur au département des études maritimes de l'Université de Haïfa, a déclaré qu'il ne pensait pas que les dauphins aient été affectés par la pollution, mais qu'il espérait qu'ils retourneraient bientôt en mer. ""Il semble qu'ils soient assez détendus. Ils ne semblent pas être stressés"", a-t-il déclaré.
Le port de Haïfa est bordé par des sociétés chimiques qui déversent des déchets toxiques dans l'eau depuis des décennies. Bien que les niveaux de pollution aient diminué ces dernières années, l'eau est toujours considérée comme un danger pour la santé.
""Il y a beaucoup de poissons dans le port de Haïfa. Malheureusement, nous n'avons pas pu dire aux dauphins que les poissons ne sont pas sains ; et je ne sais pas quel sera le résultat"", a-t-il déclaré à la radio de l'armée israélienne. Des centaines d'habitants de Haïfa se sont rassemblés autour du port de Haïfa pour voir ce spectacle intéressant, et les chercheurs ont déclaré que cela offrait une occasion rare de filmer et d'étudier les dauphins à dents rugueuses. En plus des dizaines de dauphins qui ont nagé dans le port mardi, un nombre similaire est resté à l'extérieur de la digue. Plus tard mardi, les dauphins ont quitté le port mais sont restés près de l'entrée et les garde-côtes israéliens patrouillaient la zone pour essayer de s'assurer que les dauphins ne retournaient pas dans les eaux toxiques.

"  Avec des milliers de chutes d'eau à travers le monde, il est difficile de choisir les meilleures, mais la liste suivante contient quelques-unes des plus étonnantes et belles du monde !
Les chutes d'Iguazu : situées à la frontière du Brésil et de l'Argentine, les chutes d'Iguazu sont réputées pour leur beauté panoramique. Bien qu'elles ne mesurent que 89 mètres de haut, elles se classent au quatrième rang des plus belles chutes du monde en raison de leur beauté. La falaise en forme de U dans la chute d'eau, connue sous le nom de « gorge du diable », est la caractéristique la plus frappante de la chute d'eau.
Les chutes d'Angel : nommées d'après leur découvreur, James Crawford Angel, les chutes d'Angel sont les plus hautes du monde, avec une hauteur de 979 mètres. Elles sont situées dans l'État de Bolívar au Venezuela. Une caractéristique unique de ces chutes est que la majeure partie de l'eau qui tombe est emportée par les vents sous forme de brume. L'eau tombée s'écoule ensuite sous forme de rivière Churun.
Les chutes de Tugela : il s'agit des deuxièmes plus hautes chutes du monde, avec une hauteur de 947 mètres. Elles sont situées dans la province du Natal en Afrique du Sud. La source des chutes, la rivière Tugela, est une rivière d'une pureté exceptionnelle et est considérée comme potable. La particularité de ces chutes est la présence d'une série de cinq chutes d'eau spectaculaires.
Les chutes du Niagara : les chutes du Niagara sont l'une des chutes d'eau les plus puissantes au monde, avec un débit d'environ six millions de mètres cubes d'eau par minute. Elles se situent à la frontière entre le Canada et les États-Unis et se composent d'un ensemble de chutes d'eau, notamment les chutes américaines, les chutes du voile de la mariée et les chutes du fer à cheval. Elles sont réputées pour leur beauté et attirent un grand nombre de touristes du monde entier.
Les chutes du Rhin : les chutes du Rhin sont les plus grandes chutes d'eau d'Europe. Elles sont situées en Suisse, près de la frontière allemande. Ce sont l'une des plus anciennes chutes d'eau, dont on pense qu'elles se sont formées il y a environ dix-sept mille ans.

"Lorsque Lucy et Maria Aylmer disent aux gens qu'elles sont jumelles, la réaction est l'incrédulité. Les jeunes femmes de 18 ans de Gloucester, au Royaume-Uni, sont deux des cinq enfants nés de leur père caucasien et de leur mère ""mi-jamaïcaine"". Alors que leurs autres frères et sœurs ont un mélange de traits de leurs parents qui ont des couleurs de peau différentes, Lucy et Maria sont uniques : Lucy a la peau claire et les cheveux roux, tandis que Maria a la peau brune et les cheveux foncés.

""Personne ne croit jamais que nous sommes jumelles parce que je suis blanche et Maria est noire"", a déclaré Lucy. ""Même lorsque nous nous habillons de la même manière, nous ne ressemblons pas à des sœurs, sans parler de jumelles. Lorsque nous rencontrons des amis pour la première fois, ils refusent tous de croire que nous sommes jumelles et certains nous ont même obligées à produire nos certificats de naissance pour prouver que nous sommes vraiment jumelles.""

Contrairement aux jumeaux identiques, les jumeaux fraternels sont nés de deux ovules distincts. La BBC rapporte que pour un couple biracial qui attend des jumeaux, il y a environ une chance sur 500 que ces jumeaux aient des couleurs de peau différentes.

Les Aylmer sont fières de leur singularité.

"Dans le bus, dans le métro, chaque tête est baissée vers un téléphone portable, une tablette ou un autre appareil numérique. Mais cela signifie-t-il que de plus en plus de gens se tournent vers la lecture numérique ?

Selon l’Enquête nationale sur la lecture, avant la 17e Journée mondiale du livre le 23 avril, seulement 1,2 % des Chinois ont déclaré lire beaucoup. Mais 38,6 % ont déclaré lire sur des appareils numériques comme les téléphones portables et les liseuses électroniques. Il s’agit d’une augmentation de 17,7 % par rapport à 2010.

De nombreux experts évoquent une tendance à la lecture fragmentée, c’est-à-dire la lecture de nombreux messages ou éléments courts sur un appareil numérique comme un téléphone portable plutôt qu’un long texte dans un livre.

Zhao Jianmin, professeur à l’Université de Shanghai, a déclaré que la lecture fragmentée faisait partie de la vie moderne. « Le rythme de vie rapide ne laisse pas beaucoup de temps aux gens pour s’asseoir et lire un livre entier, a-t-il déclaré. Donc, profiter du temps fragmenté pour lire est assurément une tendance. »

La lecture fragmentée présente des avantages. Les gens peuvent profiter d’une grande quantité d’informations, de connaissances et de divertissement en peu de temps. La lecture numérique est plus rapide que la lecture traditionnelle en profondeur.

Cependant, certains experts craignent que la tendance de la lecture numérique ne conduise les gens à lire de manière simpliste. Xu Guosheng, de l’Académie chinoise de la presse et des publications, affirme que la lecture fragmentée rend plus difficile pour les gens de réfléchir davantage à ce qu’ils lisent. Il a également averti que la lecture fragmentée pourrait rendre les gens paresseux pour mémoriser des faits, car ils savent qu’ils peuvent toujours simplement chercher des réponses en ligne.

« La lecture fragmentée est parfois bonne, mais ne la laissez pas prendre tout votre temps », a suggéré Tian Zhilng, un éditeur. Il a déclaré qu’il était important de lire des livres de qualité plus en profondeur, et que nous devrions lire pour acquérir des connaissances, pour un usage pratique et pour le plaisir. Il a suggéré aux gens de choisir d’abord des livres faciles, puis de passer à des livres plus difficiles.

"Lorsque mon premier Noël de guerre est arrivé, j'étais en entraînement de base dans le New Jersey et je ne savais pas si je pourrais rentrer à la maison pour les fêtes. Ce n'est que dans l'après-midi du 23 décembre que la liste des hommes qui auraient des passes de trois jours a été affichée. J'étais l'un des chanceux soldats.

Le pin atteignait la hauteur appropriée, presque jusqu'au plafond, et l'étoile de cristal du sommet de l'arbre était à sa place.

"BEIJING - Un haut responsable de la Commission nationale du développement et de la réforme (NDRC), le principal planificateur économique de la Chine, a annoncé vendredi que les tarifs ferroviaires chinois pour le fret et le transport de passagers continueront d'être fixés par le gouvernement.

Cao Changqing, responsable du département des prix de la NDRC, a déclaré que le pays continuera de mettre en œuvre des prix fixés par le gouvernement ou guidés par le gouvernement pour le secteur ferroviaire après la mise en activité de la China Railway Corporation (CRC), une société d'État qui reprend les fonctions commerciales de l'ancien ministère des Chemins de fer (MOR), le 17 mars.

Cao a déclaré que le secteur ferroviaire, constituant les principales infrastructures de transport public de la Chine, est une industrie de base clé. Son système de tarification est préoccupé à la fois par le fonctionnement et le développement normaux du secteur, ainsi que par les déplacements quotidiens et les intérêts vitaux du grand public.

L'État fera preuve de beaucoup de prudence pour toute modification des prix dans le secteur ferroviaire, en tenant compte de divers facteurs, notamment l'exploitation, la construction, l'acceptation du public et le développement coordonné avec d'autres modes de transport, selon le responsable de la NDRC.

Conformément à la législation et à la réglementation chinoises, des audiences seront organisées avant toute modification du prix de base des billets de train de voyageurs, a déclaré Cao.

Dans la dernière réforme ferroviaire chinoise, approuvée lors de la session annuelle récemment achevée de la plus haute instance législative du pays, l'ancien MOR a été démantelé en deux parties, la CRC nouvellement créée assumant les fonctions commerciales et une administration ferroviaire étatique remplissant les fonctions administratives.

"  Beijing (Xinhua) : Lorsqu'elle est apparue sur scène, chantant une chanson japonaise, des centaines d'adolescents excités se sont massés autour d'elle en criant : ""Curarpikt ! C'est Curarpikt !""
    Au salon du manga et de l'animation de Beijing la semaine dernière, c'est exactement qui était Shi Jia. La jeune fille de Première année du lycée cosplayait ""Curarpikt"", un personnage du populaire manga japonais Hunter X Hunter (<<>> ) de Yoshihiro Togashi.
    ""Je fais du cosplay de Curarpikt parce que je l'aime"", a déclaré la jolie jeune fille de 15 ans. ""Je suis touchée par son histoire triste et j'ai été attirée par son courage et sa personnalité.""
    Dans l'histoire de manga d'aventure, Curarpikt, un garçon beau et au grand cœur, lutte pour devenir un chasseur afin de capturer les personnes qui ont tué sa tribu.
    Shi a lu tous les mangas et est une grande fan de la série animée de Hunter X Hunter. Puis l'année dernière, elle a vu un véritable ""Curarpikt"" dans un spectacle de cosplay.
    ""J'avais déjà regardé des spectacles de cosplay avant, mais juste pour le plaisir"", a-t-elle expliqué. ""C'est vraiment excitant de voir des jeunes gens porter le maquillage et les costumes de personnages que vous avez lus et que vous connaissez bien.""
    ""Mais cette fois-là, je suis tombée amoureuse du cosplay, probablement parce que j'aime beaucoup Curarpikt. J'ai pensé que je pourrais jouer le personnage mieux, alors j'ai décidé de tenter ma chance.""
    Shi a acheté du tissu et a demandé à un tailleur de lui faire un costume de Curarpikt. Elle a été ravie de découvrir qu'il y avait un spectacle de cosplay à Beijing en octobre.
    ""C'est une excellente façon de passer les vacances nationales. Poser sur scène pour tous les fans de mangas, je savais que je faisais quelque chose que j'avais toujours voulu faire"", a-t-elle déclaré.
    Mais elle ne parle jamais de son passe-temps à ses parents.
    ""Ils pensent que cela va me distraire de mes études. Je ne veux pas les contrarier, c'est mon passe-temps secret"", a-t-elle déclaré. ""C'est aussi pourquoi je ne me teins pas les cheveux pour le cosplay comme tous les autres.""

"Quelques conseils :
(1) Jouez toujours dans un endroit sûr. Un parc est un endroit sûr car il n'y a ni voitures ni camions. Mais ne parlez à personne que vous ne connaissez pas. Ne montez jamais dans une voiture avec un inconnu.
(2) Avant de traverser la route, arrêtez-vous et regardez des deux côtés. Regardez à gauche, regardez à droite, regardez encore à gauche.
(3) Éloignez-vous des maisons ou des bâtiments en construction ou en démolition. Quelque chose pourrait vous tomber sur la tête ou vous pourriez vous couper avec de l'herbe cassée.
(4) Les médicaments ou les pilules peuvent être dangereux. N'avalez jamais les pilules ou les médicaments que vous trouvez dans le placard.
(5) Portez un gilet de sauvetage lorsque vous sortez en bateau. Même si vous n'êtes pas en pleine mer et que l'eau n'est pas profonde, vous devez porter votre gilet de sauvetage. Il est facile de tomber d'un bateau.
(6) Ne sortez pas la tête d'une voiture, d'un bus ou d'un train. De nombreux enfants ont été tués en faisant cela.","{

"Il y a quarante ans, un groupe d'étudiants universitaires s'est rendu dans les montagnes de Bornéo pour examiner les populations de papillons de nuit. Aujourd'hui, une équipe de scientifiques britanniques, dont un membre du voyage initial, est retournée sur les mêmes sites pour répéter l'enquête. Ils ont constaté que, en raison de la hausse des températures, les insectes vivent désormais 68 mètres plus haut.

Le réchauffement climatique oblige les espèces tropicales à monter en altitude pour échapper aux températures croissantes, à un rythme d'environ 2 mètres par an, suggère la nouvelle étude menée à Bornéo.

Comme c'était la seule chance de répéter l'enquête originale, les scientifiques ont tout fait pour la réaliser exactement de la même manière, en se rendant à la même période de l'année, en juillet et août, en utilisant des photographies pour retrouver les sites exacts des pièges à papillons de nuit.

""Bien qu'il s'agisse de la première étude sur les insectes, quelques autres études sur les espèces tropicales commencent à apparaître"", a déclaré Thomas. ""Si vous examinez toutes ces études, vous trouverez les mêmes résultats, et il est extrêmement difficile de trouver une autre explication à ces résultats.""

Alors que certaines espèces pourraient survivre en trouvant des endroits sur les montagnes avec des températures similaires à celles de leurs habitats d'origine, d'autres pourraient manquer d'habitat sur les pics rocheux, avertit l'étude.

Dans un article publié dans la revue Nature en 2004, Thomas et 13 autres experts ont analysé les habitats de 1 100 espèces sur cinq continents et ont estimé qu'en moyenne un quart d'entre elles étaient menacées d'extinction.

L'année dernière, un article publié dans la Public Library of Science aux États-Unis a averti que le risque d'extinction dans les tropiques devenait de plus en plus grave. Les auteurs, Jana et Steven Vamosi, ont estimé que 20 à 45 % des espèces tropicales étaient menacées d'extinction.

"Lorsque Joan a donné naissance au premier garçon de sa famille en trois générations, elle et son mari étaient ravis. Ses parents aussi. Joan s'attendait à ce que sa sœur aînée, Sally, soit tout aussi ravie qu'eux. Joan avait toujours admiré Sally - la beauté et la star de la famille - et était heureuse de ses réussites.
Mais depuis l'arrivée du bébé, les sœurs se sont distancées. Joan se sent blessée car Sally semble complètement indifférente à son bébé. Sally, qui n'a pas d'enfants, affirme que sa sœur cadette ""agit comme si personne n'avait jamais eu de bébé auparavant"".
Ni Sally ni Joan ne comprennent que la véritable cause du froid actuel est que leurs rôles familiaux ont soudainement changé à l'opposé. Finalement, Joan semble être meilleure que sa sœur aînée - et Sally n'aime pas ça ! Leur distance peut être temporaire, mais elle montre que la compétition d'enfance ne disparaît pas facilement avec l'âge. Elle peut rester puissante dans les relations tout au long de la vie.
Dans une étude de l'Université de Cincinnati, 65 hommes et femmes âgés de 25 à 93 ans ont été interrogés sur leurs sentiments envers leurs frères et sœurs. Près de 75 % ont admis avoir des sentiments compétitifs cachés. Dans quelques cas, ces émotions étaient si fortes qu'elles avaient affecté toute leur vie.
De nombreux frères et sœurs adultes sont proches, solidaires - mais ont tout de même tendance à être en compétition. Deux frères que je connais se transforment en tueurs lorsqu'ils se trouvent sur des côtés opposés d'un filet de tennis. En dehors du court, ils sont les meilleurs amis. Ma propre sœur cadette ne peut pas attendre de me dire quand j'ai pris du poids. Cependant, elle est une terrible cuisinière et cela me fait plaisir ; je me moque d'elle quand elle vient dîner. Heureusement, malgré ces petites faiblesses, nous avons été une ressource importante l'un pour l'autre.

"Il existe des histoires concernant deux présidents américains, Andrew Jackson et Martin Van Buren, qui tentent d'expliquer l'origine du terme anglais ""OK"". Nous ne savons pas si l'une ou l'autre de ces histoires est vraie, mais elles sont toutes deux intéressantes.

La première explication est basée sur le fait que le président Jackson avait très peu d'éducation. En fait, il avait du mal à lire et à écrire. Lorsque des documents importants parvenaient à Jackson, il essayait de les lire et demandait ensuite à ses assistants de lui expliquer ce qu'ils disaient. S'il approuvait un document, il y inscrivait ""all correct"". Le problème était qu'il ne savait pas comment épeler. Donc, ce qu'il écrivait réellement était ""ol korekt"". Après un certain temps, il a raccourci ce terme en ""OK"".

La deuxième explication est basée sur le lieu de naissance du président Van Buren, Kinderhook, New York. Les amis de Van Buren ont organisé un club pour l'aider à devenir président. Ils ont appelé le club ""Old Kinderhook Club"", et tous ceux qui soutenaient Van Buren étaient appelés ""OK"".

"Il se sentait à nouveau faible, mais il s'accrochait au grand poisson avec toute la force qu'il pouvait. Je l'ai bougé, pensa-t-il. Peut-être que cette fois je peux le faire passer. Tire, mains, pensa-t-il. Tiens bon, jambes. Dernier effort pour moi, tête. Dernier effort pour moi. Tu n'y es jamais allé. Cette fois, je le ferai passer. 
Mais lorsqu'il fit tout son effort, le commençant bien avant que le poisson n'arrive à son bord et tirant de toutes ses forces, le poisson passa en partie et se redressa ensuite pour s'éloigner en nageant. 
""Poisson"", dit le vieil homme. ""Poisson, tu vas devoir mourir de toute façon. Dois-tu me tuer aussi ?""
Comme ça, rien n'est accompli, pensa-t-il. Sa bouche était trop sèche pour parler, mais il ne pouvait plus atteindre l'eau maintenant. Je dois le faire passer à son bord cette fois, pensa-t-il. Je ne suis pas bon pour beaucoup d'autres tours. Si, tu l'es, se dit-il. Tu es bon pour toujours. 
Au tour suivant, il était presque arrivé. Mais le poisson se redressa à nouveau et s'éloigna lentement en nageant. 
Tu me tues, poisson, pensa le vieil homme. Mais tu en as le droit. Jamais je n'ai vu une chose plus grande, ou plus belle, ou plus calme ou plus noble que toi, frère. Vas-y, tue-moi. Je me fiche de qui tue qui. 
Maintenant, tu commences à être confus dans ta tête, pensa-t-il. Tu dois garder la tête froide. Garde la tête froide et sache souffrir comme un homme. Ou comme un poisson, pensa-t-il. 
""Clarifie-toi, tête"", dit-il d'une voix qu'il pouvait à peine entendre. ""Clarifie-toi.""
Deux fois de plus, ce fut la même chose aux virages. 
Je ne sais pas, pensa le vieil homme. Il avait été sur le point de se sentir partir à chaque fois. Je ne sais pas. Mais je vais essayer une fois de plus. 
Il essaya une fois de plus et il sentit qu'il allait partir lorsqu'il tourna le poisson. Le poisson se redressa et repartit lentement en nageant, la grande queue se balançant dans l'air. 
Je vais essayer encore une fois, promit le vieil homme, même si ses mains étaient maintenant molles et qu'il ne pouvait plus bien voir que par éclair. 
Il essaya encore une fois et ce fut la même chose. Alors il pensa, et il sentit qu'il allait partir avant même de commencer ; je vais essayer encore une fois. 
Il prit toute sa douleur et ce qui restait de sa force et de sa fierté disparue depuis longtemps et il l'opposa à l'agonie du poisson et le poisson passa sur son côté et nagea doucement sur son côté, son bec presque touchant les planches du canot et commença à passer le bateau, long, profond, large, argenté et barré de violet et interminable dans l'eau. 
Le vieil homme lâcha la ligne et mit son pied dessus et leva le harpon aussi haut qu'il le pouvait et le fit descendre de toute sa force, et de plus de force qu'il venait de rassembler, dans le flanc du poisson juste derrière la grande nageoire pectorale qui montait haut dans l'air jusqu'à la hauteur de la poitrine de l'homme. Il sentit le fer entrer et il s'appuya dessus et le fit pénétrer plus loin, puis il poussa tout son poids après lui. 
Alors le poisson revit, avec sa mort en lui, et sortit haut de l'eau montrant toute sa grande longueur et sa largeur, et toute sa puissance et sa beauté. Il semblait flotter dans les airs au-dessus du vieil homme dans le canot. Puis il tomba dans l'eau avec un fracas qui envoya des embruns sur le vieil homme et sur tout le canot.

"En raison de la domination coloniale britannique, l'anglais est la deuxième langue la plus parlée en Inde après l'hindi. Bien qu'il semble être une langue secondaire, il ne fait aucun doute de sa croissance immense au fil des années dans l'histoire indienne. C'est la principale langue acceptée et parlée dans les domaines des affaires et de l'éducation dans tous les endroits en Inde. L'Inde se classe troisième au monde pour sa population anglophone, après les États-Unis et le Royaume-Uni.

L'écriture anglaise s'est épanouie en Inde et a atteint un sommet où des écrivains indiens comme Arundhati Roy, Vikram Seth et Salman Rushdie ont pu se démarquer dans le monde entier. De nombreux auteurs indiens publient des livres sur la culture et la littérature indiennes. Shobha De, une célèbre chroniqueuse de mode et de style de vie, est l'une des écrivaines importantes à mentionner qui ont ouvert la voie aux autres.

Un certain nombre de journaux comme The Hindu, Times of India et Indian Express ont considérablement augmenté la popularité et l'acceptation de l'anglais en Inde. Ils ont joué un rôle important dans la diffusion de l'anglais dans tous les coins du pays.

L'un des principaux contributeurs à la promotion du développement de la langue anglaise en Inde est le système éducatif. Les écoles et collèges privés jouent un rôle majeur dans la préparation des étudiants aux compétences orales et écrites en anglais. Le niveau est tellement élevé que nous pouvons voir de jeunes étudiants participer activement à des discussions de groupe et à des concours de quiz pour montrer leurs talents dans le monde entier.

Le cinéma indien n'est pas en reste. Chaque année, il sort de nombreux films en anglais en Inde. La capitale mondiale du cinéma n'est pas Hollywood, mais Bollywood, surnom de l'industrie cinématographique indienne située à Mumbai. Des films comme ""Coup de génie"" et ""Le Mariage des moussons"" ont une grande influence internationale.

"Un chien retrouvé abattu à la tête et au visage avec une arme à air comprimé, enfermé dans un sac poubelle et laissé pour mourir, se remet de ses blessures dans une clinique vétérinaire au Texas. Le sac contenant le mâle croisé de 3 ans a été découvert attaché à une clôture à Conroe, au Texas, plus tôt ce mois-ci. Lorsque des résidents locaux ont ouvert le sac, le chien est apparu, a fait quelques pas et est tombé.
Augustyn a emmené le chien en urgence à une clinique vétérinaire, où il a été soigné pour de nombreuses plombs au visage, aux yeux, à la bouche, au cou et aux épaules. Le chien a été stabilisé, mais selon le Dr Ron Hendrick, vétérinaire à la clinique d'urgence vétérinaire de Conroe, des plombs restent dans les deux yeux et on ne sait pas si le chien surnommé Buck restera aveugle à jamais.
Une page Facebook, Buck Needs Bucks for His Buckshot Injuries, a été lancée la semaine dernière par Augustyn. Elle a été créée pour aider à payer les frais médicaux du chien. La page a attiré près de 7 000 ""j'aime"" et, selon son créateur, déjà plus que suffisamment de dons pour payer son traitement.
""Les 24 dernières heures ont été accablantes pour moi"", a écrit Augustyn sur la page. ""Je suis passée de ne pas savoir si j'aurais assez d'argent pour payer la facture d'urgence de Buck à avoir une somme d'argent incroyable pour lui fournir les meilleurs soins possibles pour sa guérison. J'ai longuement réfléchi à cela aujourd'hui et à la façon dont je devrais gérer cela. La conclusion est que j'ouvrirai un compte bancaire séparé pour Buck et tous les dons seront utilisés pour sa récupération et ses besoins."" Grâce à l'aide de Facebook, l'histoire de Buck a rapidement suscité un intérêt international. ""Buck marche maintenant"", dit Augustyn.
La police du comté de Montgomery a déclaré enquêter sur l'incident, et Augustyn a déclaré être en contact avec les forces de l'ordre pour faire don d'une récompense en échange d'informations conduisant à l'arrestation de la personne qui a torturé le chien.

"Cet après-midi, mon bureau a envoyé plus de 34 000 notifications par e-mail aux lycéens qui attendaient de savoir s'ils seraient invités à passer les quatre prochaines années à Stanford. Même si je travaille dans le domaine des admissions depuis plus de 30 ans, je ressens toujours la douleur de nombreux jeunes exceptionnels qui n'ont pas obtenu de place.

Étant donné que les adolescents d'aujourd'hui sont déjà confrontés à suffisamment de pression dans leur vie, je souhaite transmettre trois messages aux parents particulièrement déçus.

Premièrement, tout est relatif. Alors que le nombre d'admissions dans la classe de premier cycle reste inchangé depuis des années, Stanford, comme beaucoup de ses écoles homologues, a enregistré un nombre record de candidatures totales - plus de 42 000. Indépendamment des arguments sur le fait que trop de préférence est accordée à une catégorie par rapport à une autre, des milliers d'étudiants vont être refusés, et il ne fait aucun doute que la grande majorité d'entre eux auraient pu répondre aux exigences d'une éducation à Stanford.

J'aimerais qu'il existe une formule pour expliquer qui est accepté et qui ne l'est pas, mais la prise de décision est autant un art qu'une science. Chaque classe est une symphonie avec sa propre composition et son propre son distincts. La liste finale est un effort pour créer de l'harmonie, et cela signifie que certains bassistes extraordinaires ne trouvent pas de place. De plus, même parmi mon personnel, il existe des différences légitimes quant aux candidats.

Deuxièmement, célébrez le tableau d'ensemble. La plupart des candidatures que j'ai examinées sont vraiment remarquables. La transition du lycée à l'université est un tournant, et il est plus important de se concentrer sur la façon dont un jeune adulte passe à une nouvelle étape que sur l'endroit où cette étape se trouve. Vous devriez saluer le succès de vos enfants et vous réjouir de l'excitation que les quatre prochaines années apporteront.

Et cela nous amène à mon dernier point : l'éducation est ce que l'étudiant en fait. Bien sûr, certaines écoles ont des ressources que d'autres n'ont pas, mais elles offrent toutes des possibilités d'apprendre et de grandir. Des milliers de candidats qui ne sont pas admis à Stanford continuent à vivre des vies épanouissantes. Ce que les parents et les candidats à l'université dans tout le pays doivent se rappeler, c'est que les nouvelles qu'ils reçoivent, qu'elles soient bonnes ou mauvaises, ne sont qu'une étape sur un voyage beaucoup plus long.

"En 1972, le National Park Service a mis en place une politique concernant les incendies de forêt appelée ""Brûlage Naturel"". Il a été reconnu que certains incendies de forêt, comme ceux causés par la foudre, étaient nécessaires au maintien d'écosystèmes forestiers équilibrés, et que ces feux devraient être autorisés à brûler. Cependant, un grand incendie dans le parc national de Yellowstone en 1988 a entraîné l'abandon de cette politique, car l'incendie a été initialement autorisé à brûler, mais il est rapidement devenu incontrôlable. En conséquence, l'incendie de 1988 a détruit une grande partie de Yellowstone, le parc national le plus ancien et le plus aimé des États-Unis. De vastes zones de végétation ont été détruites, et les visiteurs ont été accueillis par de grands espaces vides et des acres d'arbres brûlés et noircis. Les rivières et les ruisseaux étaient obstrués par les cendres, et l'écosystème du parc a été irréversiblement modifié.

De plus, un grand nombre d'animaux ont été tués par les incendies qui sont devenus incontrôlables. Les feux, attisés par des vents forts, se déplaçaient jusqu'à dix milles par jour. De nombreux petits animaux sont morts dans les flammes. L'avancée rapide des incendies a laissé peu de chances à la faune de s'échapper. Même aujourd'hui, peu de ces petits animaux forestiers sont retournés vivre dans le parc. Dans les années qui ont immédiatement suivi les incendies, le nombre de visiteurs a rapidement diminué. Personne n'était intéressé à voir un parc noirci et sans arbres en vacances. Yellowstone était auparavant célèbre pour ses vues incroyables et ses formations géologiques uniques, comme le geyser Old Faithful. Mais sa réputation de merveille américaine est maintenant irrémédiablement ternie.

"Au début de l'automne, j'ai déposé une demande d'admission à l'université. Je ne voulais aller nulle part ailleurs que à l'université Cornell, mais ma mère s'y est fortement opposée. En me voyant étudier une photographie de mon père sur le terrain de sport de Cornell, elle l'a déchirée.

""Tu ne peux pas dire que ce n'est pas une grande université, juste parce que Papa y est allé.""

""Ce n'est pas du tout ça. Et c'est une université de premier plan."" Elle tenait toujours les morceaux dans sa main. ""Mais nous n'avons pas les moyens de te payer des études.""

""Je ne songerais même pas à vous demander de l'argent. Voulez-vous que je trouve un emploi pour vous aider à soutenir Papa et toi ? Les choses ne sont pas si mauvaises, n'est-ce pas ?""

""Non,"" dit-elle. ""Je ne m'attends pas à ce que tu nous aides à subvenir à nos besoins.""

Papa a emprunté de l'argent à ses riches cousins pour monter une petite bijouterie. Ses principaux clients étaient ses anciens camarades de classe. Pour trouver de nouveaux clients, ma mère a dû aider. Elle a repris une adhésion oubliée depuis longtemps à la ligue locale des femmes, afin de pouvoir faire connaissance avec plus de gens. Que ces gens se transforment en clients était une autre question. Je savais que mes parents devaient attendre assez longtemps avant que leur petit investissement ne puisse rapporter des fruits. De plus, ils n'avaient pas suffisamment voulu être riches et prospères ; sinon, ils n'auraient pas pu gérer leur vie aussi mal.

J'étais déchiré entre le désir de les aider et de changer leur vie, et la détermination à ne pas répéter leurs erreurs. J'avais une forte conviction en mon pouvoir d'aller où je voulais. Après des mois d'études acharnées, j'ai obtenu une bourse d'études complète à l'université. Mon père était incapable de cacher sa fierté envers moi, et ma mère a finalement cédé devant mon succès.

"Une organisation de protection des animaux affirme que des chasseurs tuent des animaux de manière cruelle aux États-Unis. On estime qu'il existe environ 1 000 fermes de chasse à travers le pays, dont les propriétaires offrent aux chasseurs l'occasion de tuer des animaux maintenus dans des zones clôturées.

Des sangliers russes, des zèbres, des cerfs, des antilopes et de nombreuses autres espèces sont élevées uniquement pour être tuées. Les propriétaires de fermes facturent des milliers de dollars aux chasseurs pour les animaux qu'ils tuent, dont beaucoup sont en voie d'extinction.

La Humane Society of the United States affirme que ce type de chasse doit être arrêté car il est injuste envers les animaux. De nombreux propriétaires élèvent leurs animaux. D'autres les achètent à des marchands d'animaux ou à des zoos et des cirques qui n'en veulent plus. Cela signifie que les animaux ne craignent pas les humains et sont faciles à tirer par les chasseurs.

Les propriétaires de petites fermes maintiennent leurs animaux dans des zones clôturées afin que les chasseurs puissent s'approcher des animaux avant de tirer. Dans les grandes fermes, les chasseurs sont emmenés dans des zones où les animaux sont nourris à certains moments de la journée. Cela facilite également le massacre des animaux.

Les chasseurs souhaitent conserver la tête et la poitrine des animaux qu'ils tuent pour les accrocher comme trophées à leurs murs. Cela signifie que les animaux sont généralement tirés dans des parties du corps. Cela signifie qu'ils vont souffrir d'une mort lente et douloureuse.

La chasse est autorisée dans la majeure partie des États-Unis, mais certaines régions du pays l'ont arrêtée ou restreinte. La Humane Society of the United States espère que les autres régions du pays abandonneront ce sport cruel dans un avenir proche.

"Il est largement reconnu que toute conversation anglaise commence par la météo. Cette fixation sur la météo trouve son expression dans le célèbre commentaire du Dr Johnson selon lequel ""Lorsque deux Anglais se rencontrent, leur première conversation porte sur la météo."" Bien que l'observation de Johnson soit aussi précise aujourd'hui qu'il y a plus de deux cents ans, la plupart des commentateurs ne parviennent pas à fournir une explication convaincante de cette météo-langue anglaise.

Bill Bryson, par exemple, conclut que, comme la météo anglaise n'est pas du tout excitante, l'intérêt qu'elle suscite est difficilement compréhensible. Il soutient que ""Pour un étranger, la chose la plus frappante à propos de la météo anglaise, c'est qu'il n'y en a pas beaucoup."" Tout simplement, la raison en est que la météo inhabituelle et imprévisible est presque inconnue dans les îles britanniques.

Jeremy Paxman, cependant, est en désaccord avec Bryson, soutenant que la météo anglaise est par nature attrayante. Bryson a tort, dit-il, car la préférence des Anglais pour la météo n'a rien à voir avec les phénomènes naturels. ""L'intérêt porte moins sur les phénomènes eux-mêmes, mais sur l'incertitude."" Selon lui, le temps en Angleterre est très changeant et incertain et il attire les Anglais ainsi que les étrangers.

Bryson et Paxman représentent des idées reçues courantes sur la météo-langue parmi les Anglais. Les deux commentateurs, d'une certaine manière, manquent le point. La conversation sur la météo anglaise ne porte pas vraiment sur la météo. La météo-langue anglaise est un système de signes, développé pour aider les locuteurs à surmonter la réserve naturelle et à parler réellement les uns aux autres. Tout le monde sait que les conversations commençant par la météo-langue ne sont pas des demandes de données météorologiques. Ce sont plutôt des salutations de routine, des amorces de conversation ou des ""remplissages"" vides. En d'autres termes, la météo-langue anglaise est un moyen de lien social.

"Tout le monde n'a pas la chance d'être un détective, mais j'en ai eu une quand j'avais 13 ans. C'est arrivé en 1994.

Un après-midi, je marchais dans la rue quand j'ai vu la nouvelle voiture de mon père. Je m'attendais à voir mon père au volant. Mais à ma surprise, j'ai vu une jeune femme conduire à la place. ""Elle a volé la voiture de mon père"", ai-je pensé. J'ai donc rapidement arrêté un taxi et suis monté dedans. J'ai dit au chauffeur : ""Suivez cette nouvelle voiture devant"", et je lui ai expliqué pourquoi.

Le chauffeur de taxi avait un téléphone dans sa voiture, alors je lui ai demandé d'appeler la police. Bientôt, nous avons entendu le son d'une voiture de police. La police a demandé à la femme d'arrêter la voiture en utilisant un haut-parleur. Le taxi s'est arrêté aussi. Je suis descendu tout de suite et j'ai dit à la femme : ""Ce n'est pas votre voiture. C'est la voiture de mon père.""

La femme a souri et a dit : ""Oh. Vous êtes le fils de M. Johnson, n'est-ce pas ? J'ai vu votre photo dans le bureau de votre père.""

Avant que je ne puisse dire un mot, la femme a expliqué qu'elle était la nouvelle assistante de mon père. Mon père lui avait demandé d'emmener son ordinateur au magasin pour le faire réparer. Il lui avait prêté sa voiture. Après avoir entendu cela, j'ai appelé mon père et il nous a dit que ce que la femme avait dit était vrai. La police et le chauffeur de taxi ont ri.

"Il était une fois un fermier. Sa terre était vallonnée et le sol n'était pas le meilleur. Il avait une vache qui ne donnait pas beaucoup de lait et des poules qui pondaient peu d'œufs. La ferme avait l'air délabrée et la grange ainsi que les clôtures avaient besoin de réparations. Le fermier et sa femme se sentaient démoralisés.
Un soir d'orage, un homme mal habillé frappa à leur porte, leur demandant s'il pouvait trouver refuge pour la nuit. Ils partagèrent la nourriture qu'ils avaient préparée, tout en discutant longuement de la ferme.
Lorsque l'étranger quitta le lendemain matin, il remercia le fermier et sa femme et sortit un petit sac de pièces d'or de sa poche. Il dit que peut-être cela les aiderait. Il ajouta qu'il reviendrait l'année suivante avec l'espoir de trouver une ferme revitalisée.
Après cela, le fermier et sa femme ont souvent discuté de l'opportunité d'acheter une vache plus prometteuse. D'autres fois, ils envisageaient d'acheter des poules qui pondaient plus d'œufs. Cependant, chaque conversation se terminait par le fermier qui faisait confiance à l'amélioration de la ferme, car il se retrouvait à réparer la grange et les clôtures, à s'occuper des animaux, à préparer de la nourriture pour eux-mêmes et leurs animaux.
Le fermier rayonnait de joie lorsque l'étranger revint un an plus tard. Tout avait l'air tellement mieux. L'étranger demanda : « Qu'avez-vous fait de l'or ? »
Le fermier répondit : « Nous avons caché l'or sous une tuile de la cuisine et, bien que nous y ayons souvent pensé, nous n'avons jamais trouvé quelque chose pour lequel nous avions besoin de l'or. »
Puis le fermier ajouta pensivement : « Je vous remercie quand même beaucoup. Vous nous avez donné ce dont nous avions vraiment besoin pour continuer : vous avez relevé notre moral. »
En disant cela, le fermier enleva la tuile et rendit joyeusement l'or à l'étranger.

"Si vous allez dans un restaurant de fast-food, vous verrez probablement beaucoup d'adolescents. Aujourd'hui, de nombreux adolescents sont en surpoids, et cela est dû à leurs mauvaises habitudes alimentaires. La plupart des adolescents aiment les aliments riches en graisses, en huile, en sel et en sucre. Les gens appellent ce type d'aliments ""malbouffe"".

Mais les mauvaises habitudes alimentaires vont au-delà de la restauration rapide. Nous constatons que de nombreux adolescents mangent de manière malsain. Certains ne prennent pas de petit-déjeuner avant d'aller à l'école. Pendant la journée, certains ne prennent pas de repas convenable pour le déjeuner. Lors d'une enquête récente dans une école, des scientifiques ont constaté que plus des deux tiers des élèves ne suivaient pas un régime alimentaire sain. Ils n'aimaient pas les légumes, et beaucoup d'entre eux n'aimaient pas manger des fruits. Ils préféraient manger des aliments riches en sel, en sucre ou en graisse.

Les parents d'aujourd'hui s'inquiètent également du régime alimentaire de leurs enfants. Certains médecins donnent les conseils suivants :

Les adolescents ne devraient pas manger trop de malbouffe.
Les adolescents ne devraient pas manger des aliments trop riches en sel. Le sel peut provoquer de l'hypertension artérielle à l'avenir.
Les adolescents devraient manger des aliments sans beaucoup de graisses, d'huile et de sucre.
Les adolescents ont besoin de manger des fruits et des légumes chaque jour. Les fruits et les légumes sont riches en vitamines et pauvres en graisses.

"Les astronautes, les personnes qui voyagent dans l'espace, ont besoin d'une formation spéciale. Tout d'abord, ils se rendent à Houston, au Texas. C'est le siège du Centre spatial Johnson. Là, ils sont mis à l'épreuve pour voir à quel point ils sont forts et intelligents.

L'un des premiers tests est pour le cœur. Les personnes marchent ou courent, puis les médecins spatiaux vérifient la vitesse de leur cœur.

Un autre test important est effectué. Lors de ce test, la personne doit se mettre en boule. Lorsqu'il est dans cette position, il est placé dans un sac rond en tissu. Les médecins ne lui donnent aucune indication sur la durée pendant laquelle il devra rester dans le sac. Si un vaisseau spatial tombait en panne dans l'espace, les astronautes se mettraient dans des sacs comme celui-ci. Ils devraient alors attendre et se blottir dans l'obscurité jusqu'à l'arrivée des secours. Vous pouvez voir qu'un astronaute ne doit pas avoir peur des espaces restreints ou de l'obscurité.

Après les tests, seuls les meilleurs candidats sont choisis pour commencer la formation d'astronaute dans un centre de formation. Les astronautes en formation apprennent de nombreuses autres choses. Ils apprennent à sauter d'un avion en mouvement. Ils apprennent à gonfler un canot de sauvetage et à y monter lorsqu'ils sont dans l'océan. Les astronautes doivent également apprendre à être hissés hors de l'océan par hélicoptère. Cela peut paraître amusant, mais c'est dangereux.

Après avoir terminé leur formation, les astronautes continuent à travailler. Ils restent en bonne forme en courant et en faisant de l'exercice. Ils lisent sur leurs fonctions particulières. De cette façon, ils peuvent apprendre de nouveaux faits sur les voyages spatiaux.

Puis arrive le grand jour. L'astronaute est chargé de se rendre au travail pour un vol dans l'espace. Les membres d'équipage apprennent d'abord à se connaître. Ensuite, ils peuvent savoir quelle fonction chacun d'eux aura.

"Un traitement expérimental qui provoque une fièvre dangereusement élevée chez les patients atteints du SIDA s'est révélé prometteur comme moyen de prolonger et d'améliorer la vie des patients. Appelé Biologic-HT System, le nouveau traitement permet aux médecins d'extraire le sang d'un patient et de le chauffer avant de le faire circuler à nouveau dans le corps. Le sang chauffé provoque une élévation de la température corporelle du patient au-dessus de 42 degrés Celsius. Chez les personnes atteintes du SIDA, cette augmentation de la température tue certains VIH sensibles à la chaleur, le virus, disent la plupart des médecins, qui est à l'origine du SIDA.
Le chauffage du sang des patients atteints du SIDA a déjà été essayé auparavant, disent les médecins. Mais lors des tentatives précédentes, le traitement a provoqué des changements chimiques mortels dans le sang. Le système Biologic-HT empêche ces changements de se produire, permettant à la chaleur de tuer les virus avec peu d'effets secondaires.
Le nouveau traitement thermique ne peut pas être considéré comme un remède contre le SIDA, affirme le président de l'entreprise qui fabrique le système. Il affirme que le traitement ne tue pas toutes les traces du virus. Cependant, il tue suffisamment de particules virales pour donner au système immunitaire du patient un répit dans son duel mortel contre le VIH.
Les tests du traitement Biologic-HT ont débuté sur 36 patients plus tôt cette année. Le traitement dure environ quatre heures et le patient se sent généralement assez bien pour quitter l'hôpital ou la clinique le lendemain matin.
Jusqu'à présent, les patients qui ont suivi le traitement disent se sentir mieux et n'ont développé aucune nouvelle infection opportuniste - des maladies qui frappent les personnes dont le système immunitaire est affaibli. Les patients ont également connu une augmentation d'environ 50 % du nombre de cellules T dans leur corps. Les cellules T sont des cellules clés du système immunitaire qui luttent contre les maladies et la principale cible du VIH.

"  Dans un avenir proche, les gens de certaines régions du monde regarderont un nouveau type de télévision. Il s'appelle la télévision haute définition ou HD-TV. La principale différence entre une HD-TV et une télévision normale est l'image. Elle est plus claire et plus détaillée. En effet, la HD-TV possède beaucoup plus de points et de lignes qui composent une image télévisuelle. Chaque image de télévision en couleur contient des milliers de points rouges, verts et bleus. Ils se combinent tous pour former une image dans l'œil de la personne qui regarde. Les points sont organisés en lignes qui traversent l'écran de télévision. Il y a plus de cinq cents lignes dans une télévision normale. La HD-TV en a deux fois plus. Pour obtenir cette image claire, vous devez avoir un grand écran. Les experts disent que les gens utilisant un petit écran verront peu de différence.
La HD-TV a également un son clair. C'est comme le son d'un CD. Toutes ces améliorations font qu'une HD-TV est très coûteuse. Un modèle au Japon se vend actuellement plus de vingt mille dollars.

"Mary Cassette est l'une des premières grandes peintres américaines. Elle a suivi ses rêves et est devenue artiste. Elle est née le 22 mai 1844 et a vécu en Europe pendant plusieurs années dans son enfance. 
Sa famille est retournée aux États-Unis et à l'âge de 16 ans, Mary a fréquenté la Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. Quatre ans plus tard, elle s'est rendu compte qu'elle ne pouvait plus apprendre à Philadelphie, alors ses parents l'ont renvoyée en Europe. Là, elle a étudié les techniques des maîtres à Rome, Séville, Anvers et Paris. 
Mary a eu la chance de sa vie en 1877 lorsque le célèbre peintre français, Edgar Degas, lui a demandé de rejoindre un groupe de peintres qui comprenait des artistes maintenant célèbres comme Monet et Renoir. Leur style de peinture est appelé impressionnisme. Ils utilisaient des couleurs primaires et des coups de pinceau courts dans leurs œuvres. Ils ont reconnu le talent puissant de Mary et l'ont invitée à exposer dans les expositions d'art impressionnistes. 
Mary a peint ce qu'elle voyait : des jardins et des portraits, en particulier de mères et d'enfants dans la vie quotidienne. L'un de ses tableaux, Jeune mère et deux enfants, a été donné à la Maison Blanche en 1954 où il est exposé aujourd'hui. 
Mary ne s'est jamais mariée et, en 1877, ses parents et sa sœur ont déménagé en Europe pour la rejoindre. Mary a consacré une grande partie de son temps à eux pendant les 18 années suivantes. Mary a peint jusqu'en 1914 lorsque sa vue défaillante a rendu impossible la poursuite de son art. Elle est décédée en 1926 à l'âge de 82 ans.

"Monsieur White travaille dans un bureau. Il aimait lire au lit quand il était à l'école. C'était mauvais pour ses yeux et maintenant il est myope. Mais il ne voulait pas que quelqu'un d'autre le sache et il ne porte jamais de lunettes. Cela lui cause souvent des problèmes.

Un matin d'hiver, il a été envoyé en mission dans une école de village. Il est descendu d'un bus à un arrêt dans une petite ville. Ensuite, il a dû marcher jusqu'à l'école. Le chemin menant au village n'était pas lisse. Il y avait des pierres ici et là. Il est tombé plusieurs fois et cela a rendu ses vêtements très sales. Finalement, il est arrivé au village. Soudain, il a commencé à souffler fortement et il a fait beaucoup plus froid. Son chapeau a été emporté par le vent alors qu'il cherchait l'école. Il a dû courir après, mais il n'a pas pu le rattraper. Il se demandait pourquoi son chapeau courait dans une maison comme s'il avait des jambes. Et puis il a couru dans la maison aussi.

"On dit que le vrai marathon commence à 35 kilomètres - le reste n'est qu'un échauffement. Et effectivement, en 2009, vers le 36ème kilomètre du marathon de Pékin, j'ai vécu ce que les coureurs appellent ""toucher le mur"". J'avais bien couru jusqu'à ce point, mais soudain j'ai ressenti une douleur aiguë à la jambe. Mon rythme a considérablement ralenti et chaque cellule de mon cerveau semblait crier ""arrête !!!""

Les 5 derniers kilomètres n'ont pas été agréables ; en fait, ils ont été très pénibles. Rester motivé pour courir ces derniers kilomètres a été l'une des choses les plus difficiles que j'aie jamais faites. Mais c'est ce qui rend la course à pied d'un marathon si enrichissante - si c'était facile, tout le monde le ferait.

Je dois admettre que parfois, ce n'est même pas facile de trouver la motivation pour sortir du lit, enfiler ses chaussures de course et se diriger vers le matin pour aller courir. Ces deux dernières semaines d'entraînement pour l'ascension du Muztagata ont été un peu difficiles. Je suis mon programme d'entraînement depuis environ trois mois, mais je constate maintenant que mon enthousiasme initial a été épuisé. Aller à la salle de sport jour après jour commence à me fatiguer et il me semble qu'il reste encore beaucoup de temps pour continuer. J'ai commencé à douter de faire des progrès ou de devenir plus en forme et j'ai même pensé que je pouvais régresser !

Ce sont toutes des expériences très courantes pour les personnes qui travaillent à des objectifs stimulants à long terme et j'ai appris à reconnaître ces ""hauts"" et ""bas"" dans mon énergie et mon enthousiasme. Au fil des années, j'ai appris un certain nombre d'astuces qui m'aident à gérer les jours où ma motivation initiale semble m'avoir abandonné pour de bon.

"Le Sweetest Day en Amérique a toujours lieu le troisième samedi d'octobre. Cette fête est beaucoup plus importante dans certaines régions que dans d'autres (Détroit, Cleveland et Buffalo étant les plus grandes villes du Sweetest Day). C'est une fête qui gagne en popularité chaque année dans tout le pays.

Le Sweetest Day est célébré le troisième samedi d'octobre comme un jour pour rendre quelqu'un heureux. C'est une occasion qui nous offre à tous la possibilité de nous souvenir non seulement des malades, des personnes âgées et des orphelins, mais aussi des amis, des parents et des associés dont nous avons apprécié l'aide et la gentillesse.

Il y a plus de 60 ans, un homme de Cleveland, convaincu que les orphelins et les personnes isolées de la ville se sentaient trop souvent oubliés et négligés, a eu l'idée de leur montrer qu'ils étaient bien pensés. Il a fait cela en distribuant de petits cadeaux. Avec l'aide de ses amis et de ses voisins, il a distribué ces petits souvenirs un samedi d'octobre. Au cours des années qui ont suivi, d'autres habitants de Cleveland ont commencé à participer à la cérémonie de célébration, qui a été appelée ""Sweetest Day"". Au fil du temps, l'idée du Sweetest Day de répandre la joie aux démunis a été élargie pour inclure tout le monde, et est devenue une occasion de se souvenir des autres avec un acte de gentillesse ou un petit souvenir. Et bientôt, l'idée s'est répandue dans d'autres villes du pays.

Le Sweetest Day ne se base pas sur l'affection religieuse d'un groupe particulier ni sur une relation familiale. C'est un rappel qu'un mot ou un geste attentionné enrichit la vie et lui donne un sens.

Parce que pour beaucoup de gens, se souvenir prend la forme d'un cadeau, le Sweetest Day nous offre l'occasion de montrer aux autres que nous nous soucions d'eux, de manière pratique.

"Mark Rothko, l'un des plus grands peintres du XXe siècle, est né à Daugavpils, en Lettonie, en 1903. Sa famille a immigré aux États-Unis en 1913, après un voyage de 12 jours.

Mark a déménagé à New York à l'automne 1923 et a trouvé du travail dans le commerce du vêtement et s'est installé dans le Upper West Side. C'est lors d'une visite à quelqu'un à l'Art Students League qu'il a vu des étudiants peindre un modèle. Selon lui, cela a marqué le début de sa vie d'artiste. Il avait vingt ans et avait suivi quelques cours d'art à l'école, donc son expérience initiale était loin d'être une vocation immédiate.

En 1936, Mark Rothko a commencé à écrire un livre, qu'il n'a jamais terminé, sur les similitudes entre l'art des enfants et le travail des peintres modernes. L'œuvre des modernistes, influencée par l'art primitif, pouvait, selon lui, être comparée à celle des enfants en ce sens que ""l'art enfantin se transforme en primitivisme, qui n'est que l'enfant produisant une copie de lui-même."" Dans cette même œuvre, il a déclaré que ""Le fait que l'on commence généralement par le dessin est déjà académique. Nous commençons par la couleur.""

Il ne fallut pas longtemps avant que son multiforme ne se développe dans le style pour lequel il est connu. En 1949, Rothko a exposé ces nouvelles œuvres à la Betty Parsons Gallery. Pour le critique Harold Rosenberg, les peintures étaient uniques et primitives. Rothko, après avoir peint sa première multiforme, s'était séparé du monde à East Hampton sur Long Island, n'invitant que très peu de personnes, dont Rosenberg, à voir les nouvelles peintures. La découverte de la spécialité de ses œuvres est survenue à une période de grand chagrin : sa mère Kate est décédée en octobre 1948. Dans le cadre de cette nouvelle uniformité de vision artistique, ses peintures n'ont plus de titres individuels. À partir de ce moment, elles sont simplement sans titre, numérotées ou datées. Cependant, pour aider à distinguer une œuvre d'une autre, les marchands ajoutaient parfois les couleurs primaires au nom. De plus, pendant les quelques années suivantes, Rothko a peint à l'huile uniquement sur de grandes toiles verticales. Cela a été fait pour entourer le spectateur, ou, selon ses mots, pour faire en sorte que le spectateur se sente enveloppé dans l'image.

"Récemment, des inquiétudes ont été soulevées concernant la santé des bananiers dans le monde. De nombreux médias ont affirmé que les bananes pourraient disparaître complètement au cours des dix prochaines années.
Les bananes sont l'une des cultures alimentaires les plus importantes au monde. Elles sont également le quatrième produit d'exportation le plus précieux. Les bananes ne poussent pas à partir de graines. Au lieu de cela, elles poussent à partir de plantes existantes. Les bananes sont menacées par les maladies car toutes les plantes d'une ferme sont des copies les unes des autres. Elles partagent toutes les mêmes faiblesses génétiques.
Par exemple, la banane Cavendish est la plus populaire sur les marchés américains. C'est une importante culture d'exportation. Cependant, certains types de champignons infectent facilement la Cavendish. La maladie de la Sigatoka noire affecte les feuilles des bananiers Cavendish. La maladie est contrôlée dans les grandes fermes en appliquant des produits chimiques sur les feuilles des plantes. Les agriculteurs appliquent des produits chimiques antifongiques sur leurs cultures jusqu'à une fois par semaine.
Une autre maladie fongique est plus grave. La maladie de Panama attaque les racines du bananier. Il n'existe aucun traitement chimique pour cette maladie. Les plantes infectées doivent être détruites. La maladie de Panama a touché les cultures en Asie du Sud-Est, en Australie et en Afrique du Sud. On craint qu'elle ne se propage aux bananes cultivées en Amérique. Cela pourrait menacer un important produit d'exportation pour l'Amérique centrale et du Sud.
Le Réseau international pour l'amélioration de la banane et du plantain, dont le siège est en France, soutient la recherche sur les bananes. Le groupe affirme que des recherches supplémentaires doivent être menées pour développer de nouveaux types de bananes.
Le groupe affirme que les maladies fongiques n'affectent principalement qu'un seul type de banane. En fait, il existe cinq cents types de bananes différents. L'Organisation des Nations unies pour l'alimentation et l'agriculture affirme que la banane Cavendish ne représente que dix pour cent de la production mondiale.
L'agence de l'ONU affirme que les agriculteurs devraient cultiver différents types de bananes. Cela protège contre les maladies qui n'affectent qu'un seul type. Les experts avertissent que les maladies pourraient entraîner la disparition de la banane Cavendish. Cela est déjà arrivé à une banane populaire en raison de sa faiblesse génétique contre les maladies.

"Dans la cuisine des maisons de ma mère, il y a toujours eu un support en bois avec un petit bloc-notes et un trou pour un crayon.
Je cherche du papier pour noter le nom d'un livre que je recommande à ma mère. Plus de quarante ans depuis mes premiers souvenirs du bloc-notes et du crayon de la cuisine, cinq maisons plus tard, le papier et le crayon actuels ont l'air identiques à ce qu'ils ont toujours été.  C'est sûr, ce ne peut pas être le même crayon ? Le bloc-notes est plus moderne, mais le support en bois est définitivement celui d'origine.
""Je suis juste étonnée que tu aies toujours le même support pour tenir le bloc-notes et le crayon après toutes ces années"", lui dis-je en retournant dans le salon avec une feuille de papier et le crayon. ""Tu utilises toujours un crayon. Tu ne peux pas te permettre un stylo ?""
Ma mère répond un peu sèchement : ""Ça marche parfaitement bien. J'ai toujours gardé le support dans la cuisine. Je ne savais jamais quand je pourrais avoir besoin de noter une idée, et j'étais toujours dans la cuisine à cette époque.""
Immédiatement, je peux l'imaginer, les cheveux en bataille, sa robe de chambre bleue recouverte de farine, une cuillère en bois dans une main, le crayon dans l'autre, sa bouche bougeant silencieusement. Ma mère sourit et dit : ""Un jour, je cuisinais et je surveillais bébé Pauline, et j'ai eu une idée géniale, mais le support était vide. Un des enfants doit avoir pris le papier. Alors j'ai juste pris la planche à pain et j'ai tout écrit au dos.  Il s'est avéré que c'était une véritable percée pour résoudre le problème mathématique sur lequel je travaillais.""
Cette histoire – qui s'est produite avant ma naissance – me rappelle à quel point ma mère était, et est, extraordinaire en tant que mathématicienne de talent. J'ai honte de me plaindre de ne pas avoir assez de temps libre pour travailler. Plus tard, alors que ma mère est dans la salle de bain, je vais dans sa cuisine et retourne les planches à pain.  Effectivement, au dos de la plus petite, il y a des marques au crayon que je reconnais comme étant des mathématiques. Ces symboles ont voyagé sans dommage pendant cinquante ans, enracinés dans le sol d'une planche à pain en bois bon marché, des expositions invisibles à chaque repas.

"Aux États-Unis, il existe une perception répandue selon laquelle un diplôme universitaire est la clé du succès. Mais un nombre croissant d'éducateurs affirment aujourd'hui qu'il existe d'autres possibilités, en particulier pour les étudiants qui pourraient ne pas réussir au niveau universitaire.

Ce n'est pas une salle de classe traditionnelle. Au programme d'apprentissage géré par le syndicat des plombiers et des monteurs de vapeur du Maryland, Travis Strawderman et d'autres étudiants gagnent de l'argent tout en apprenant. « Cela a complètement changé ma vie », a-t-il déclaré. « J'ai pu rembourser toutes mes dettes. Je peux dire que je suis vraiment assez responsable pour avoir ma propre famille. »

Le programme de cinq ans de Strawderman lui apprend des compétences techniques gratuitement. Il dit qu'il avait envisagé l'université, mais cela ne l'intéressait pas. Le professeur d'économie Robert Lerman affirme que Strawderman n'est pas un cas isolé. « Beaucoup de gens s'ennuient au lycée », a déclaré Lerman. « Ils quittent le lycée parce qu'ils s'ennuient. Ils veulent faire autre chose que de s'asseoir en classe. » Lerman affirme que le système éducatif américain est trop axé sur le fait de pousser les élèves à fréquenter l'université. « Ce que nous faisons maintenant, c'est que nous disons que si vous n'apprenez pas de cette façon, vous n'avez pas vraiment la chance d'avoir une carrière enrichissante », a-t-il déclaré.

Mais Chad Aldeman, un analyste, affirme que des études montrent que plus les élèves restent longtemps à l'école, plus ils ont de chances d'avoir une carrière bien rémunérée et stable. « Si vous êtes seulement titulaire d'un diplôme d'études secondaires, vos salaires vont baisser au cours de votre vie, contrairement à un diplôme universitaire », a-t-il déclaré. « Le diplôme universitaire est vraiment une assurance contre le chômage et les faibles salaires. »

"Le meilleur et le pire aspect d'être un jeune adulte dans la vingtaine est que chaque décision que vous prenez peut changer le reste de votre vie. Une fois que vous avez la trentaine ou la quarantaine, il devient de plus en plus difficile de vous réinventer. J'ai donc fait un entretien avec le Dr Meg Jay, psychologue clinicienne. Il explique pourquoi la vingtaine compte, et comment en tirer le meilleur parti.

Selon le Dr Meg Jay, nos années 20 sont la décennie décisive de l'âge adulte. 80% des moments les plus importants de la vie se produisent avant l'âge de 35 ans. Et 2/3 de la croissance salariale à vie se produisent au cours des dix premières années d'une carrière. Plus de la moitié des Américains sont mariés ou sortent avec leur futur partenaire ou vivent avec lui avant l'âge de 30 ans. La personnalité peut changer davantage pendant nos années 20 que pendant toute autre décennie de la vie. La fertilité féminine culmine à 28 ans. Le cerveau termine sa dernière croissance majeure. En matière de développement adulte, 30 ans ne sont pas les nouveaux 20 ans. Même si vous ne faites rien, ne pas faire de choix est un choix en soi. Ne vous laissez pas définir par ce que vous ne saviez pas ou que vous n'avez pas fait.

D'un autre côté, je lui ai aussi demandé comment les vingtenaires suivent leur progression vers leurs objectifs futurs et si des étapes comme 21 ans et 30 ans sont vraiment importantes. Le Dr Meg Jay pense que c'est vraiment important. Les étapes - 21 ans, 25 ans, 30 ans, le Nouvel An, les anniversaires, les retrouvailles - sont importantes parce qu'elles provoquent une introspection. Ce qu'il a mentionné est le suivant : Suis-je où je voulais être à cet âge ? Ai-je fait ce que j'ai dit que je ferais cette année ? Si non, pourquoi ? Et si ce n'est pas maintenant, quand ? Une jeune fille de 20 ans qui m'a interviewée récemment m'a parlé d'une question qu'on lui avait conseillé de se poser en progressant dans l'âge adulte : ""Si vous continuez à vivre votre vie exactement comme elle est, où serez-vous dans 3 ans ?"" Si vous n'aimez pas la réponse, c'est le moment de changer de cap.

Bien sûr, la vingtaine est une période d'expérimentation, mais pas seulement avec des philosophies, des vacances et des substances. La vingtaine est votre meilleure chance d'expérimenter des emplois et des relations. Ensuite, chaque mouvement peut être plus intentionnel et plus éclairé que le précédent.

"Il ne fait aucun doute que l'enseignement supérieur est accepté depuis longtemps. Tous les diplômés du secondaire devraient y aller, selon la sagesse conventionnelle et les données statistiques, car l'université les aidera à gagner plus d'argent, à devenir de ""meilleures"" personnes et à apprendre à être des citoyens plus responsables que ceux qui n'y vont pas.

Mais l'université n'a jamais été en mesure de faire fonctionner sa magie pour tout le monde. Et maintenant que près de la moitié de nos diplômés du secondaire y assistent, ceux qui ne correspondent pas au modèle deviennent plus nombreux et plus évidents. Les diplômés universitaires vendent des chaussures et conduisent des taxis ; les étudiants universitaires s'interfèrent dans les expériences des uns et des autres et rédigent de fausses lettres de recommandation dans la féroce compétition pour être admis dans des écoles supérieures. D'autres ne trouvent aucune stimulation dans leurs études et doivent donc abandonner, ce qui est souvent encouragé par les administrateurs universitaires.

Certains observateurs disent que la faute est aux jeunes eux-mêmes - ils sont gâtés et ils s'attendent à trop. Mais c'est une condamnation des étudiants dans leur ensemble, et cela n'explique pas tout le malheur du campus. D'autres blâment l'état du monde, et ils ont en partie raison. On nous a dit que les jeunes doivent aller à l'université parce que notre économie ne peut pas absorber une armée de jeunes de dix-huit ans non formés. Mais les diplômés déçus apprennent qu'elle ne peut plus absorber une armée de jeunes de vingt-deux ans formés non plus.

"Il existe un nouveau type de petite annonce qui devient de plus en plus courant dans les colonnes des petites annonces des journaux. Il est parfois placé parmi les ""situations vacantes"", bien qu'il n'offre aucun emploi, et parfois il apparaît parmi les ""situations recherchées"", bien qu'il ne soit pas placé par quelqu'un qui recherche un emploi. Ce qu'il fait, c'est offrir de l'aide dans la recherche d'emploi.
""Contactez-nous avant de rédiger votre candidature"", ou ""Profitez de notre longue expérience dans la préparation de votre curriculum vitae ou de votre historique professionnel"", c'est ainsi qu'il est généralement exprimé. La croissance et le succès apparent d'un tel service spécialisé reflètent bien sûr les niveaux élevés de chômage actuels. C'est également une indication de l'importance croissante du CV, avec la suggestion qu'il pourrait maintenant être qualifié d'œuvre d'art à part entière.
Il fut un temps où les demandeurs d'emploi écrivaient simplement des lettres de candidature. ""Mettez simplement votre nom, votre adresse, votre âge et si vous avez passé des examens"", c'était à peu près le niveau moyen de conseil offert aux jeunes qui postulaient pour leur premier emploi lorsque j'ai quitté l'école. La lettre n'était vraiment que pour l'ouverture, expliquait-on, tout le reste pouvait et devait être réservé pour l'entretien. Et à cette époque de plein emploi, la technique fonctionnait. La lettre prouvait que vous saviez écrire et que vous étiez disponible pour travailler. Votre visage enthousiaste et vos réponses intelligentes faisaient le reste.
Il ne fait aucun doute, cependant, que c'est le nombre croissant de candidats ayant une éducation universitaire à tous les niveaux du processus d'embauche qui a conduit à l'importance accrue du CV.

J'avais mis de côté mon travail de journaliste politique car mes idées avaient changé. J'en étais venu à croire que ce qui se passait dans le tiers monde était plus important que tout le reste. Mais pour comprendre comment vivent les trois quarts de la population mondiale et comment leur avenir pourrait affecter le nôtre, j'ai estimé qu'il fallait d'abord essayer de partager leur mode de vie. Finalement, j'ai choisi un village de montagne parce qu'il faisait un peu plus frais que ceux des plaines. J'ai pris le bus de la ville par une route cahoteuse. Puis il y a eu une marche difficile sur un chemin raide jusqu'à la rivière. Après cela, j'ai commencé l'ascension dans les Mils. Chaque fois que je m'arrêtais pour reprendre mon souffle, j'avais une vue magnifique. Après plusieurs heures de marche, le village est apparu.

"Dans une salle de classe américaine, un professeur a demandé à une fille chinoise de répondre à une question. Elle s'est levée et a souri, sans faire aucun bruit. Le professeur américain s'est regardé et n'a rien vu de drôle. Il lui a donc posé la question à nouveau. La fille a juste souri mais n'a rien dit. Le professeur était en colère. Il ne savait pas que la fille souriait pour cacher son embarras parce qu'elle ne savait pas comment répondre à la question.

"Une jeune femme diplômée d'une université de renommée mondiale aspirait à travailler comme traductrice pour des personnalités influentes. Elle était ravie d'intégrer l'ambassade britannique. Elle considérait cela comme le plus grand bonheur de sa vie, car de nombreux diplômés convoitaient ce poste, et elle faisait partie des rares à l'obtenir !

Cependant, une fois installée dans son nouveau rôle, elle réalisa que son travail se résumait à répondre au téléphone et à noter les heures d'arrivée et de départ des membres du personnel. C'était un travail ingrat, sans perspectives d'avenir. Pourtant, elle ne se laissait pas abattre. Elle apprit à aimer son travail. Et elle l'aimait lorsqu'elle l'exerçait. Les noms et numéros de téléphone des membres du personnel étaient inscrits dans son carnet, ce qui lui permettait de les mémoriser. Lorsqu'un appel arrivait, elle décrochait le plus rapidement possible. Si quelqu'un lui demandait qui était absent du bureau, elle lui fournissait le bon nom et l'heure de son départ. Personne d'autre ne pouvait le faire aussi bien qu'elle.

Ses excellentes performances lui valurent non seulement les compliments du personnel de l'ambassade, mais aussi des employés du gouvernement local. Un dirigeant d'une célèbre entreprise britannique fut également impressionné par ses compétences et l'invita à travailler pour lui. Elle devint ensuite traductrice personnelle d'un dirigeant important du Royaume-Uni et fut appréciée des étrangers.

Nous ne pouvons pas choisir notre destin, mais nous pouvons choisir l'attitude avec laquelle nous affrontons la vie. Peut-être que cette attitude peut changer notre destin. Si nous pleurons sur la vie, la vie sera grise. Si nous sourions à la vie, la vie nous sourira également.

"Une chercheuse du sommeil de l'Université Brown a un conseil pour les responsables des lycées : Ne commencez pas les cours si tôt le matin. Il se peut que les élèves qui somnolent à leur bureau ne soient pas paresseux. Et il se peut que leurs parents n'aient pas réussi à faire respecter l'heure du coucher. Au lieu de cela, il se peut que, biologiquement, ces élèves endormis ne soient pas habitués à cette heure matinale.

""Peut-être que ces enfants sont obligés de se lever à un moment qui ne convient pas à leur corps"", déclare Mary Carskadon, professeur qui étudie le problème du sommeil chez les adolescents à l'École de médecine de Brown.

Carskadon essaie de mieux comprendre les effets des débuts de cours matinaux chez les adolescents. Et, à un niveau plus fondamental, elle et son équipe essaient d'en savoir plus sur la façon dont les changements biologiques de l'adolescence affectent les besoins et les habitudes de sommeil.

Carskadon affirme que ses travaux suggèrent que les adolescents ont peut-être besoin de plus de sommeil qu'ils n'en avaient à l'enfance, pas moins, comme on le pense souvent.

Les habitudes de sommeil changent pendant l'adolescence, comme le peut prouver n'importe quel parent d'adolescent. La plupart des adolescents préfèrent se coucher plus tard le soir et dormir plus tard le matin. Mais ce n'est pas seulement une question de choix, leur corps traverse un changement de rythme de sommeil.

Tout cela rend la transition du collège au lycée, qui peut commencer une heure plus tôt le matin, d'autant plus difficile, explique Carskadon. Avec leur besoin accru de sommeil et leurs horloges biologiques réglées sur le rythme ""se coucher tard, se lever tard"", les adolescents se heurtent à des difficultés lorsqu'ils doivent se lever à 5 ou 6 heures du matin pour une première sonnerie à 7h30. Une courte sieste sur un ordinateur portable peut être la façon pour leur corps de dire : ""J'ai besoin d'une pause"".

Pendant les mois d'hiver, les gens attrapent facilement des rhumes et la grippe. Beaucoup pensent qu'il s'agit de la même chose, mais ces deux maladies sont différentes.

Les rhumes peuvent durer jusqu'à une semaine. Vous aurez le nez qui coule, un mal de gorge, des maux de tête, une toux et de la fièvre.

La grippe est plus grave. Vous vous sentirez malade très rapidement. Vous aurez de la fièvre et des maux de tête. Votre corps vous fera mal et vous vous sentirez faible. Cela peut durer jusqu'à quatre semaines.

Existe-t-il un moyen d'éviter les rhumes et la grippe ? Éviter les personnes atteintes de rhume ou de grippe peut fonctionner.

Essayez de ne pas vous toucher le nez ou les yeux si vous avez été près de quelqu'un qui a un rhume. Lavez-vous les mains, surtout après vous être mouché.

"Conduite en Amérique
Restez à droite
La circulation suit la règle « restez à droite ». En conduisant, restez du côté droit de la route. Sur une route à sens unique à plusieurs voies, la voie la plus à droite serait la plus lente et la voie la plus à gauche la plus rapide.
Signaux manuels
Bien que les clignotants soient utilisés pour indiquer la direction que vous prenez, il est très important de connaître certains signaux manuels, et ils sont généralement toujours demandés lors d'un test de conduite. Lorsque vous souhaitez tourner à droite, vous pouvez sortir votre main gauche de la fenêtre et la pointer vers le haut. Lorsque vous souhaitez tourner à gauche, vous pouvez sortir votre bras gauche de la fenêtre et le pointer vers la gauche. Si vous souhaitez ralentir ou vous arrêter, vous pouvez simplement pointer vers le bas.
Bus scolaires
Les bus scolaires jaunes ont des feux rouges clignotants et des panneaux d'arrêt qui sortent du côté du conducteur. Les conducteurs utilisent ces signaux d'avertissement pour faire monter et descendre les élèves. Peu importe de quel côté de la route vous circulez, si vous croisez un bus scolaire avec ses feux clignotants et un panneau d'arrêt utilisé, vous devez vous arrêter. C'est la loi. Restez arrêté jusqu'à ce que les feux cessent de clignoter ou que le panneau d'arrêt soit retiré.
Utilisation du klaxon
L'utilisation du klaxon n'est pas courante en Amérique. En fait, ils sont très rarement utilisés. Vous pouvez utiliser votre klaxon pour avertir les piétons ou les autres conducteurs d'un danger possible ou pour éviter des accidents. N'utilisez pas votre klaxon pour exprimer votre colère ou vous plaindre des erreurs des autres conducteurs ou pour essayer de faire avancer plus vite un conducteur lent.

"Les feux d'artifice sont généralement un plaisir pour de nombreux adolescents. Même si cela n'est pas légal dans de nombreuses régions, certains trouveront toujours un moyen d'obtenir des feux d'artifice et de faire la fête. Vous connaissez peut-être des adolescents qui utilisent des feux d'artifice d'une autre manière, par exemple pour tenter de mettre le feu à des bâtiments. Cela peut entraîner de graves problèmes juridiques. Non seulement il n'est pas légal d'avoir des feux d'artifice, mais les adolescents seront également accusés des dommages causés aux bâtiments. Vous pensez peut-être que c'est amusant, mais c'est dangereux pour les autres ainsi que pour votre avenir. Il est dangereux de déclencher des feux d'artifice, surtout si vous ne savez pas comment les déclencher. Les adolescents qui ne connaissent pas la bonne façon de déclencher des feux d'artifice peuvent se retrouver dans de nombreux ennuis. Si quelque chose se passe mal, des blessures corporelles peuvent survenir. Il est possible que les feux d'artifice ne partent pas correctement et explosent au sol.

"Aussi choquant que puisse paraître l'idée de bébés oiseaux grandissant dans un foyer rempli de fumée de cigarette, une nouvelle étude suggère que certains oiseaux pourraient tirer profit en intégrant des éléments de mégots de cigarette dans leurs nids. La nicotine qui reste dans les filtres fumés pourrait servir d'insecticide naturel, repoussant les insectes nuisibles des nids et des oisillons qui s'y trouvent. Les plants de tabac produisent de la nicotine car elle les protège des insectes qui les mangeraient autrement.

Les mégots sont indéniablement malodorants. Mais les oiseaux sont en réalité assez friands des produits chimiques odorants, comme ceux que l'on trouve dans les plantes aromatiques. Certaines espèces nidificatrices garnissent régulièrement leurs nids de produits aromatiques frais, peut-être parce que les produits chimiques sont bénéfiques pour le système immunitaire ou le développement des oisillons. Ou encore, les produits chimiques des plantes pourraient agir comme des insecticides.

Dans l'étude, des chercheurs de l'Université autonome de Tlaxcala au Mexique ont installé des pièges à chaleur, qui attirent les insectes nuisibles, dans 55 nids autour de Mexico. Certains pièges étaient doublés du contenu de filtres de cigarette fumés. Les autres étaient doublés du contenu de filtres de cigarette non fumés, qui ne contenaient pas de nicotine ni d'autres sous-produits de la fumée. Que le nid contienne des œufs, des oisillons ou rien, les pièges à cigarette non fumé ont recueilli plus d'insectes nuisibles, suggérant que ce sont les produits chimiques qui ont repoussé les insectes nuisibles.

Dans une deuxième expérience, les chercheurs ont collecté 28 nids de moineaux domestiques et 29 nids de pinsons domestiques à Mexico immédiatement après que les oisillons se sont envolés pour se nourrir. Ils ont constaté que plus un nid était rempli de contenu de filtres fumés, moins il contenait d'insectes nuisibles.

La pièce manquante du puzzle est de savoir si la réduction du nombre d'insectes nuisibles dans les nids a réellement apporté un bénéfice aux oisillons. Il n'est pas non plus clair si la nicotine ou un autre produit chimique présent dans les cigarettes a pu chasser les insectes nuisibles des nids.

Si les résultats se confirment, cette étude est un exemple d'adaptation de la faune à l'urbanisation - ou tout au moins une preuve que les oiseaux sont intelligents et peuvent toujours suivre leur odorat dans les environnements urbains.

"Aux États-Unis, les gens adorent leurs chiens et les traitent bien. Ils les promènent, les laissent jouer dehors et leur donnent de la bonne nourriture et des soins médicaux. Cependant, les chiens sans propriétaire pour s'occuper d'eux mènent une vie différente. L'expression ""mener une vie de chien"" décrit une personne qui a une existence malheureuse.

Certaines personnes disent que nous vivons dans un monde où ""c'est le chien qui mange le chien"". Cela signifie que beaucoup de gens sont en compétition pour les mêmes choses, comme de bons emplois. Elles disent que pour réussir, une personne doit ""travailler comme un chien"". Cela signifie qu'elle doit travailler très, très dur. Un travail si acharné peut rendre les gens ""fatigués comme un chien"". Et la situation serait encore pire s'ils tombaient ""malade comme un chien"".

Malgré tout, les gens disent que ""chaque chien a son jour"". Cela signifie que chaque personne profite d'une période de succès au cours de sa vie. Pour réussir, les gens doivent souvent apprendre de nouvelles compétences. Pourtant, certaines personnes disent que ""vous ne pouvez jamais apprendre de nouveaux tours à un vieux chien"". Elles pensent que les personnes âgées n'aiment pas apprendre de nouvelles choses et ne changeront pas leur façon de faire.

Certaines personnes sont comparées aux chiens de manière négative. Les personnes qui sont méchantes ou indifférentes peuvent être décrites comme ""plus méchantes qu'un chien de décharge"". Les chiens de décharge vivent dans des endroits où les gens jettent les choses qu'ils ne veulent plus. Les chiens méchants sont souvent utilisés pour garder cette propriété. Ils aboient ou attaquent les personnes qui tentent de pénétrer dans la propriété. Cependant, parfois une personne qui semble méchante et menaçante n'est pas si mauvaise en réalité. On dit que ""son écorce est pire que sa morsure"".

Les maris et les femmes utilisent cette expression ""la niche"" lorsqu'ils sont en colère l'un contre l'autre. Par exemple, une femme pourrait se mettre en colère contre son mari parce qu'il est rentré tard ou a oublié leur anniversaire de mariage. Elle pourrait lui dire qu'il est ""dans la niche"". Elle pourrait ne pas le traiter gentiment jusqu'à ce qu'il s'excuse. Cependant, le mari pourrait décider qu'il vaut mieux ""laisser dormir les chiens"" et ne pas créer plus de problèmes.

Les expressions avec ""chien"" sont également utilisées pour décrire le temps. Les ""jours de chien"" de l'été sont les jours les plus chauds de l'année. Une pluie peut rafraîchir le temps. Mais nous ne voulons pas qu'il pleuve trop fort. Nous ne voulons pas qu'il pleuve ""des cordes"".

"En 1896, Einstein s'est rendu à Zurich pour étudier la physique. Là, il a rencontré une jeune fille d'origine hongroise. Ils ont étudié dans la même classe et leur intérêt commun pour la physique les a rapprochés, faisant d'eux de bons amis. Ils sont rapidement tombés amoureux. En 1903, alors qu'Einstein avait 24 ans, il a épousé Mileva, qui était de quatre ans son aînée.

Après leur mariage, Einstein s'est consacré à la recherche de sa grande théorie. Pour aider son mari davantage, Mileva a abandonné son propre travail et est devenue une bonne épouse et assistante. Elle faisait de son mieux pour l'encourager à chaque occasion. Elle était certaine que son mari réussirait. Ils discutaient souvent de la théorie en se promenant dehors ou en étant assis ensemble dans leur chambre. Ils le faisaient même dans leurs lettres lorsque l'un d'eux était absent du domicile.

En 1914, Einstein a déménagé à Berlin et _ là. À cette époque, sa théorie s'est avérée correcte et il est devenu célèbre dans le monde entier. Mais la Première Guerre mondiale a éclaté peu de temps après. Mileva, ainsi que ses deux fils qui étaient en vacances en Suisse, n'ont plus pu revenir à Berlin. La guerre a non seulement interrompu le travail d'Einstein, mais elle a également brisé la chaleur et le bonheur de la famille. En 1919, Einstein et Mileva ont dû divorcer.

"Ayant garé ma voiture près du lavage auto à côté du supermarché, je suis sorti attendre que ma femme rentre du travail. Un homme que la société qualifierait de clochard s'approchait de moi en traversant le parking. À son allure, il n'avait ni voiture, ni maison, ni vêtements propres, ni argent. Il y a des moments où l'on se sent généreux, mais il y a d'autres moments où l'on ne veut tout simplement pas être dérangé. C'était l'un de ces moments où je ne voulais pas être dérangé.

""J'espère qu'il ne va pas me demander de l'argent"", pensais-je. Il ne l'a pas fait. Il est venu s'asseoir sur le siège près de l'arrêt de bus, mais il ne semblait pas avoir assez d'argent pour prendre le bus. Après quelques minutes, il a dit : ""C'est une très belle voiture"". Il était en haillons, mais il avait une certaine dignité autour de lui. J'ai répondu ""merci"" sans le regarder.

Il est resté assis là silencieusement pendant un moment. La mendicité tant attendue n'est jamais venue. Alors que le silence entre nous s'épaississait, quelque chose à l'intérieur de moi a dit : ""Demande-lui s'il a besoin d'aide"". J'étais sûr qu'il dirait ""oui"". Alors j'ai demandé : ""Avez-vous besoin d'aide ?"" Il a répondu en trois mots simples que je n'oublierai jamais. Ces trois mots m'ont secoué. ""Ne l'avons-nous pas tous ?"", a-t-il dit.

Je me sentais réussi et important, au-dessus d'un clochard dans la rue, jusqu'à ce que ces trois mots me frappent. Ne l'avons-nous pas tous ? J'avais besoin d'aide. Peut-être pas pour les frais de bus ou un endroit où dormir, mais j'avais besoin d'aide. J'ai fouillé dans mon portefeuille et je lui ai donné non seulement assez pour les frais de bus, mais aussi assez pour obtenir un repas chaud et un abri pour la journée. Ces trois petits mots résonnent toujours. Peu importe combien vous avez, vous avez aussi besoin d'aide. Cependant, peu importe combien vous avez, vous pouvez aussi donner de l'aide.

"Les psychologues ont des points de vue opposés sur la façon dont les récompenses externes, de la louange chaleureuse à l'argent froid, affectent la motivation et la créativité. Les behavioristes, qui étudient la relation entre les actions et leurs conséquences, soutiennent que les récompenses peuvent améliorer la performance au travail et à l'école. Les chercheurs cognitifs, qui étudient divers aspects de la vie mentale, affirment que les récompenses détruisent souvent la créativité en encourageant la dépendance à l'approbation et aux cadeaux des autres.

Ce dernier point de vue a gagné de nombreux partisans, en particulier parmi les éducateurs. Mais l'utilisation prudente de petites récompenses monétaires suscite la créativité chez les enfants du primaire, suggérant que les incitations correctement présentées aident effectivement à l'inventivité, selon une étude publiée dans le numéro de juin du Journal of Personality and Social Psychology.

""Si les enfants savent qu'ils travaillent pour une récompense et peuvent se concentrer sur une tâche vraiment difficile, ils font preuve de la plus grande créativité"", explique Robert Eisenberger de l'Université du Delaware à Newark. ""Mais il est facile de tuer la créativité en donnant des récompenses pour une mauvaise performance ou en créant trop d'anticipation pour les récompenses.""

Un enseignant qui attire constamment l'attention sur les récompenses ou qui distribue des notes élevées pour des réalisations ordinaires se retrouve avec des élèves sans inspiration, affirme Eisenberger. À titre d'exemple de ce dernier point, il note les efforts croissants des grandes universités pour resserrer les normes de notation et rétablir les notes d'échec.

Dans les classes inférieures, l'utilisation des ""économies de jetons"", dans lesquelles les élèves s'attaquent à des problèmes difficiles et reçoivent des points basés sur la performance pour obtenir des récompenses valorisées, montre une promesse d'accroître l'effort et la créativité, affirme le psychologue du Delaware.

"Stacey Hillman, âgée de 10 ans, lisait un magazine sur les chiens policiers ayant besoin de gilets pare-balles. Elle s'est dit que quelqu'un devrait commencer à collecter des fonds pour les chiens policiers.

Après avoir obtenu la permission du chef LaBrusciano, elle s'est rendue au shérif du comté, Don Eslinger. Elle s'est mise en quatre pour visiter tous les chiens policiers et informer les services de sa nouvelle association caritative. Elle a fabriqué des ""boîtes de collecte"" en utilisant des bouteilles et y a collé une photo d'elle avec un chien policier. Elle a placé ces bouteilles dans les cabinets vétérinaires et les animaleries.

Le chef du service de police de sa ville natale a aidé à faire de l'idée de Stacey une association caritative officielle - Pennies to Protect Police Dogs. Plus elle collectait d'argent, plus elle gagnait en popularité, et plus les gens se proposaient de faire des dons et de l'aider à atteindre son objectif de donner à chaque chien policier une protection efficace. 

Stacey voyage partout dans son État pour collecter des fonds et dire aux gens à quel point les chiens policiers sont importants. Elle prend la parole dans les écoles, et elles font également des dons à son association caritative. Depuis que Stacey a lancé son association caritative, elle a acheté des gilets pare-balles pour les chiens policiers avec les 140 000 dollars qu'elle a récoltés. Mais elle a beaucoup d'autres amis K-9 qui ont encore besoin d'être protégés, et elle promet de continuer son association caritative jusqu'à ce que chaque chien policier de tout le pays ait un gilet pare-balles.

Chaque gilet coûte 700 dollars, et chaque chien policier devrait en avoir un. Il n'y a pas toujours d'argent des impôts pour fournir ces gilets aux K-9, et très peu de services en ont. Les chiens policiers sauvent des vies tout comme les policiers, et souvent, les chiens policiers sont les premiers à intervenir.

"Confucius est né le 28 septembre 551 avant J.-C. Les Chinois considèrent Confucius comme le plus grand penseur et également le plus grand professeur. Il a eu environ 3 000 élèves. Pendant plus de 2 000 ans, les idées de Confucius ont été présentes dans la vie quotidienne des gens. Maintenant, elles se sont répandues en Asie orientale et du Sud. Les gens peuvent encore les entendre aujourd'hui. 

Pourquoi ses idées sont-elles si populaires ? Parce qu'elles aident beaucoup dans la vie quotidienne. Confucius a dit que les jeunes devraient s'occuper des vieux. Les gens devraient abandonner la pensée de soi et travailler pour les autres. En tant que grand professeur, Confucius a dit que tous devraient aller à l'école s'ils le pouvaient.

"Mon cher Cecil,

Juste un petit mot avant de commencer sérieusement. Quand j'ai écrit ceci, tu avais 8 ans, encore un petit garçon. En 2002, j'ai été appelé au service actif dans le Corps des Marines dans la guerre contre le terrorisme. Le 11 septembre 2001, lorsque l'Amérique a été attaquée, je savais que j'allais devoir y aller et j'étais rempli d'une profonde tristesse. Ce soir-là, alors que toi et Keiko dormiez, j'ai regardé vos petits visages et n'ai pas pu retenir mes larmes. Je savais que ce serait difficile pour toi car j'avais vécu une expérience similaire. Quand j'étais un petit garçon de 6 ans, mon père, ton grand-père Cawley, a été envoyé au Vietnam pendant la guerre là-bas. Je me souviens à quel point il me manquait aussi. Mais maintenant, malheureusement, je me rends compte à quel point cela a dû être difficile pour grand-père d'être séparé de ses enfants pendant un an. En repensant à cela, j'ai voulu mettre mes pensées et mes sentiments par écrit pour toi et ta sœur. Je suis tellement désolé d'avoir dû partir pendant si longtemps. Il n'y a nulle part où je préférerais être qu'avec toi et Keiko. Vous deux êtes les lumières de ma vie. Je n'ai connu aucun plus grand bonheur que ces quelques années depuis votre naissance. J'espère avoir encore de nombreuses années avec vous. Si cela ne se produit pas, sachez que je vous aime plus que les mots ne peuvent le dire. Si, pour une raison quelconque, je ne rentre pas à la maison, j'aurai besoin de toi pour prendre soin de ta petite sœur et de ta mère. Tu seras l'homme de la famille Cawley. Sois sage mon fils et Dieu veillera sur toi comme il a veillé sur moi. J'attendrai avec impatience le moment où nous pourrons tous être réunis à nouveau.

"Mon magasin préféré s'appelle ""Model World"". Il se trouve au deuxième étage du Happy Plaza, près du Pizza Club. Il est ouvert tous les jours de 10h à 20h.

""Model World"" vend toutes sortes de maquettes. Il propose des soldats, des voitures, des bateaux, des avions, des navettes spatiales et même des dinosaures. Il y a des maquettes pour les jeunes enfants et des maquettes pour les adultes. Certaines maquettes ne comportent qu'une vingtaine de pièces, tandis que d'autres en ont plus de 2 000.

"L'aubergine ! Délicieuse et disponible dans une variété de couleurs, et non, elle n'a rien à voir avec les poulets ! Ce légume au nom étrange est cependant aussi polyvalent qu'un œuf. Il peut être cuit à la vapeur, frit et au four. Il peut être consommé seul ou combiné avec des viandes et d'autres légumes.

L'aubergine a été cultivée pour la première fois en Inde au 5ème siècle avant J.-C. Sa popularité s'est rapidement répandue en Chine puis dans toute l'Asie. Finalement, au Moyen-Âge, le légume a fait son chemin en Europe. À cette époque, l'aubergine n'était pas le légume violet brillant que la plupart des gens connaissent aujourd'hui. Elle ressemblait plutôt à un œuf blanc. En raison de cette apparence semblable à un œuf, l'aubergine a reçu son nom. Dans ses premiers temps, le légume était si amer que les gens l'appelaient souvent ""pomme folle"". Ce surnom est apparu car les gens pensaient que son amertume était mauvaise pour la santé. Ils pensaient en fait que l'aubergine pouvait causer la folie et le cancer.

Heureusement, aujourd'hui, les gens savent que l'aubergine ne provoque ni la folie ni le cancer. En fait, l'aubergine est tellement saine qu'elle peut prévenir le cancer. De plus, le cerveau et le cœur profitent de ce super légume. Riche en fibres, l'aubergine peut améliorer la digestion.

L'Italie, la Turquie, l'Égypte, la Chine et le Japon sont les principaux producteurs d'aubergine au monde aujourd'hui. Selon sa localisation, l'aubergine peut être violette, verte, orange ou jaune-blanc. Et elle peut être aussi petite qu'une tomate ou aussi grande qu'un concombre. Les variétés de plats vont du simple au complexe, toutes étant délicieuses.

Aujourd'hui, des milliers de personnes se rassemblent à Loomis, en Californie, pour le festival annuel de l'aubergine de Loomis. La principale activité du festival est de déguster de délicieux plats à base d'aubergine. Il y a cependant beaucoup d'autres choses à faire et à voir. Des concours de recettes, des arts et de l'artisanat, des artistes, des courses et des activités pour enfants ""excitent"" les festivaliers. La plupart des gens au festival seraient d'accord : l'aubergine est un légume ""excellent"".

"Un signal électrique peut tromper le cerveau d'un singe en lui faisant croire que son doigt a été touché.

Touchez quelque chose, et votre cerveau le sait. La main envoie des signaux au cerveau pour annoncer qu'un contact a été établi. Mais cette sensation de toucher peut ne pas nécessiter un contact réel, comme le montrent de nouvelles expériences sur des singes. En stimulant les cellules cérébrales, on peut tromper l'animal en lui faisant croire que son doigt a touché quelque chose.

Une personne qui a perdu un membre ou qui est paralysée peut avoir besoin d'un membre artificiel pour effectuer ses tâches quotidiennes. Mais ces patients peuvent ne pas vraiment sentir les objets qu'ils tiennent. Les nouvelles découvertes laissent entrevoir la possibilité de créer un jour un sens du toucher chez ceux qui utilisent ces membres artificiels. Le psychologue Sliman Bensmaia, de l'Université de Chicago, a participé à ces nouvelles expériences. Les conclusions de son équipe ont été publiées le 14 octobre dans les Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America.

Le sens du toucher est crucial pour les tâches quotidiennes : les personnes qui ne l'ont pas peuvent avoir des difficultés à casser un œuf, à soulever une tasse ou même à tourner une poignée de porte. C'est pourquoi sa restauration est un objectif majeur pour les concepteurs de membres artificiels.

Dans leur nouvelle étude, Bensmaia et ses collègues ont travaillé avec des singes rhésus. Les scientifiques ont implanté des électrodes - de petits dispositifs capables de détecter et de transmettre un signal électrique - dans le cerveau des animaux. Les scientifiques ont utilisé les données des électrodes pour identifier les neurones qui étaient devenus actifs. Ensuite, les scientifiques ont utilisé les électrodes implantées pour stimuler ces mêmes neurones. Et les singes ont réagi comme si leurs doigts avaient été touchés. En fait, ils ne l'avaient pas été.

Les singes n'ont pas pu utiliser des mots pour dire aux scientifiques ce qu'ils avaient ressenti. Au lieu de cela, ils ont communiqué en regardant dans une direction particulière - comme lorsqu'ils avaient réellement été touchés.

Les nouvelles découvertes montrent comment des dispositifs sensibles au toucher pourraient être construits. La nouvelle étude offre également ""une voie claire et agréable"" pour comprendre comment restaurer le sens du toucher chez un amputé ou une personne atteinte de lésion de la moelle épinière.

L'étude montre comment les membres artificiels pourraient être connectés au cerveau afin qu'une personne puisse ""sentir"" avec une telle prothèse. Mais un tel dispositif supersensoriel n'existe pas encore et les scientifiques ont beaucoup de travail à faire avant que les gens en bénéficient. Les chercheurs doivent d'abord déterminer si les électrodes fonctionneraient chez l'homme de la même manière que chez les singes.

""Je pense que les bases sont posées pour des essais sur l'homme"", a déclaré Bensmaia.

"De nombreux grands joueurs de basket-ball ont eu des surnoms astucieux, décrivant généralement le style général du joueur sur le terrain. Voici quelques-uns des surnoms colorés parmi les joueurs NBA populaires.

""Tiny""
Nate Archibald, mesurant six pieds et un pouce, était petit pour un joueur de basket-ball. Pourtant, Archibald a utilisé sa vitesse et son intelligence pour contrôler le terrain au cours des 14 saisons qu'il a passées en NBA. Fait intéressant, son surnom est né en dehors du terrain : il a été nommé d'après son père, ""Big Tiny"".

""Magic""
Earvin Johnson a été appelé ""Magic"" par un journaliste sportif qui l'a vu jouer au basket-ball lors d'un match de lycée. Johnson était un joueur habile, faisant souvent l'inattendu, au _ de ses adversaires et au grand plaisir du public. Il a également remporté une médaille d'or en tant que membre de la ""Dream Team"" américaine aux Jeux olympiques d'été de 1992 à Barcelone, en Espagne.

""The Mailman""
Karl Malone a gagné son surnom parce qu'il était toujours performant sur le terrain. Malone a passé la majeure partie de sa carrière avec les Utah Jazz, acquérant une réputation de l'un des meilleurs ailiers-forts de tous les temps. Il a également remporté deux médailles d'or olympiques, en tant que membre de la ""Dream Team"" américaine aux Jeux olympiques d'été de 1992 à Barcelone, en Espagne, et aux Jeux olympiques d'été de 1996 à Atlanta, en Géorgie.

""The Iceman""
George Gervin a fait en sorte que les tirs les plus difficiles paraissent faciles. Il était également célèbre pour son sang-froid dans chaque match, jouant de manière détendue sous pression. Gervin, qui a passé la plupart de ses 14 années en NBA avec les San Antonio Spurs, était inégalé à bien des égards en tant qu'arrière.

"Vous pensiez que le hamburger était le fast-food le plus populaire au monde ? Après tout, les arches dorées de McDonald's s'étendent sur toute la planète. Mais non, il existe un autre fast-food véritablement universel, le fast-food ultime. Il est facile à faire, facile à servir, bien plus varié que le hamburger, peut être mangé avec les mains et est livré à votre porte ou servi dans des restaurants chics. C'est l'un des plats préférés des Américains depuis plus de 50 ans. Il s'agit bien sûr de la pizza.

Il est un peu idiot de parler du moment où la pizza a été ""inventée"". Elle a évolué au fil des ans, mais une chose est certaine : elle existe depuis très longtemps. L'idée d'utiliser des morceaux de pain plat et rond comme assiettes vient des Grecs. Ils les appelaient ""plakuntos"" et les mangeaient avec diverses garnitures simples comme de l'huile, de l'ail, des oignons et des herbes. Les Romains aimaient manger quelque chose de similaire et l'appelaient ""picea"". Vers l'an 1000 après J.-C., dans la ville de Naples, ""picea"" était devenu ""pizza"" et les gens expérimentaient des garnitures plus élaborées : du fromage, du jambon, des anchois et enfin la tomate, apportée en Italie du Mexique et du Pérou au XVIe siècle. Naples est devenue la capitale mondiale de la pizza. En 1889, le roi Humbert Ier et la reine Marguerite ont entendu parler de la pizza et ont demandé à la goûter. Ils ont invité le pizzaiolo Raffaele Esposito à la leur préparer. Il a décidé de faire la pizza à l'image du drapeau italien, en utilisant des tomates rouges, du fromage mozzarella blanc et des feuilles de basilic vertes. La reine l'a adorée et la nouvelle pizza a été nommée ""Pizza Margherita"" en son honneur.

La pizza est arrivée en Amérique avec les Italiens à la fin du XIXe siècle. La première pizzeria des États-Unis a été ouverte en 1905 au 53 Spring Street, à New York, par Gennaro Lombardi. Mais la popularité de la pizza a vraiment explosé lorsque les soldats américains sont rentrés d'Italie après la Seconde Guerre mondiale et se sont extasiés sur ""ce plat italien génial"". Les Américains sont aujourd'hui les plus grands producteurs et consommateurs de pizza au monde.

"L'amitié et les amis continuent d'être au centre de notre vie. La relation que nous partageons avec nos amis est basée sur un soin mutuel car nos amis nous aident à  _ nos personnalités également. Même à cette époque de réseaux sociaux en ligne et de cartes électroniques, le besoin de maintenir un réseau d'amis, qu'il soit en ligne ou hors ligne, reste une préoccupation majeure pour les gens. Nous ne comprenons peut-être pas complètement ce qui fait un ami, mais nous voulons tous avoir un bon nombre d'amis autour de nous.

La première étape pour se lier d'amitié avec quelqu'un est de lui faire aimer. S'il ne vous aime pas au départ, il est peu probable qu'il soit impatient de devenir votre ami. Pour faire savoir à quelqu'un que vous êtes particulièrement intéressé par lui, des gestes simples comme un petit sourire et l'appeler par son nom peuvent jeter les bases. Pour que l'autre personne se sente importante à vos yeux, vous devez être un bon auditeur et l'encourager à parler. Donnez votre opinion honnête et sincère, mais ne le critiquez pas directement ni ne vous moquez de lui ou d'elle.

La deuxième étape pour faire de quelqu'un votre ami est de développer une compréhension mutuelle. Vous devez partager ses expériences et il est nécessaire que vous développiez l'habitude de voir les choses du point de vue de l'autre personne.

La troisième et dernière étape vers l'amitié est de montrer votre soutien et vos encouragements inconditionnels à votre ami. De plus, vous devez également être très clair sur vos attentes envers votre ami. Si ce que vous attendez de la personne avec qui vous voulez vous lier d'amitié correspond à ce que cette personne peut donner, le développement de l'amitié entre vous et votre ami est sûr d'être un succès.

"Commencez-vous votre journée en dressant une liste de tout ce que vous devez faire, de la promenade du chien et du lavage des vêtements, à un appel téléphonique ou à la vérification de vos emails ? Prenez-vous toujours une liste avec vous au supermarché ? Notez-vous toutes les étapes nécessaires pour mener à bien un grand projet ? Si vous êtes un adepte des listes, vous pouvez considérer cette habitude comme quelque chose de positif. Voici quelques raisons :

**Donne un coup de pouce à votre mémoire:** Même si vous vous enorgueillissez de vous souvenir de tout ce que vous devez faire, il est humain d'oublier de temps en temps. Une liste de choses à faire est un rappel pratique.

**Aide à rester dans le moment présent:** Cela peut paraître surprenant, mais c'est vrai. Essayer de garder à l'esprit mentalement les choses qui vous préoccupent peut rendre plus difficile la concentration sur l'activité en cours.

**Réduit le stress:** Au lieu de ressentir une inquiétude persistante de ne pas avoir accompli une tâche, le fait de tenir une liste à jour peut contribuer à soulager ce type de stress.

**Aide à la planification:** La plupart d'entre nous avons tendance à remettre à demain ce que nous pouvons faire aujourd'hui, mais le fait de tenir une liste permet de contrer cette impulsion naturelle. Réfléchir à ce qui doit être fait à l'avance est un bon moyen de nous empêcher de prendre du retard.

**Permet de prioriser les tâches:** En voyant tout ce que nous voulons faire, nous pouvons établir des priorités et consacrer plus de temps aux tâches les plus importantes. D'autre part, le fait de ne pas avoir de liste de choses à faire peut nous amener à passer trop de temps sur des éléments sans importance.

**Augmente le bonheur:** Vous ressentirez beaucoup de bonheur chaque fois que vous cochez une tâche que vous avez effectuée sur votre liste. Des études montrent qu'atteindre votre objectif libère en fait des produits chimiques de bien-être dans votre cerveau, ce qui augmente le bonheur.

"Une étude a révélé que les jeunes ont une odeur plus forte et plus désagréable que les personnes âgées, tandis que l'odeur des personnes âgées est la plus distinctive, moins intense et moins désagréable. Les chercheurs ont déclaré que le changement dans notre odeur est dû aux produits chimiques que nous libérons par nos glandes et aux bactéries présentes sur notre peau.

Pour vérifier si cela existe réellement, les scientifiques ont prélevé une série d'échantillons auprès de trois groupes de 12 à 16 donneurs, âgés de 20 à 30 ans, de 45 à 55 ans et de 75 à 95 ans. Les volontaires ont porté des t-shirts spéciaux munis de coussinets sous les aisselles pendant qu'ils dormaient pendant cinq nuits, après quoi les coussinets ont été découpés et placés dans des bocaux en verre. Un groupe distinct de 41 personnes âgées de 20 à 30 ans a ensuite été invité à sentir deux bocaux à la fois et à indiquer quel groupe de donneurs était le plus âgé, ainsi qu'à évaluer l'intensité et le caractère désagréable de chaque odeur.

Lorsqu'on leur demandait de préciser si un échantillon particulier provenait d'une personne jeune, d'âge moyen ou âgée, ils étaient beaucoup plus performants pour identifier les personnes âgées. Malgré le fait d'être la plus distinctive, l'odeur des personnes âgées a également été jugée comme étant clairement moins intense et moins désagréable que celles des autres groupes.

Les chercheurs ont déclaré que leurs conclusions semblaient contredire les idées négatives des gens sur l'odeur des personnes âgées, mais ont admis que d'autres facteurs, comme la mauvaise haleine ou la peau, pourraient être à blâmer pour sa mauvaise réputation.

""Comme chez les autres animaux, les humains peuvent dégager des odeurs corporelles qui nous permettent d'identifier l'âge biologique, d'éviter les personnes malades et de choisir un partenaire adapté. Les personnes âgées ont une odeur distinctive que les jeunes considèrent comme peu désagréable. Ceci était surprenant compte tenu de la conception populaire de l'odeur de la vieillesse comme étant malodorante. Cependant, il est possible que d'autres sources d'odeurs corporelles, telles que la peau ou l'haleine, aient des qualités différentes"", a déclaré le Dr Johan Lundstrom, qui a dirigé l'étude.

"L'eau en bouteille est un fardeau pour l'environnement : le public américain consomme environ 50 milliards de bouteilles d'eau par an, et la plupart de ces contenants en plastique ne sont pas recyclés, selon le livre ""Bottlemania : How Water Went on Sale and Why We Bought It"" d'Elizabeth Royte.
Le transport des bouteilles et leur maintien au froid consomment également des combustibles qui libèrent des gaz à effet de serre. De plus, le pompage des eaux souterraines par les entreprises d'embouteillage d'eau met à rude épreuve les aquifères souterrains et nuit aux bassins versants, selon le Sierra Club. Certaines études suggèrent qu'il faut jusqu'à trois litres d'eau pour produire un litre d'eau en bouteille.
Pourtant, plus de 100 milliards de dollars sont dépensés chaque année dans le monde pour l'eau en bouteille. Dans de nombreuses villes des pays en développement où il n'y a pas de source d'eau potable sûre, l'eau en bouteille devient un choix fiable.
Aux États-Unis, l'eau du robinet est contrôlée par le gouvernement et souvent examinée pour détecter des substances polluantes dangereuses. Chaque Américain boit en moyenne 79 litres d'eau en bouteille par an, selon le Columbia Water Center de l'Earth Institute de l'Université Columbia à New York. L'industrie de l'eau en bouteille connaît un tel succès qu'elle a dépassé le lait, le café et le jus en termes de nombre de gallons de boissons vendues, se classant derrière la bière et les sodas.
Bien que la vente et la consommation d'eau en bouteille soient toujours en hausse, certains décideurs ont pris des mesures pour les réduire et encourager les gens à boire l'eau du robinet. En septembre 2009, la ville australienne de Bundanoon est devenue la première ville au monde à interdire complètement l'eau en bouteille dans les rayons de ses magasins, en construisant à la place des fontaines à eau dans toute la ville.
Parmi les villes américaines qui ont pris des mesures figurent San Francisco et Seattle, qui n'achètent plus d'eau pour les besoins de la ville, et Chicago, qui a ajouté une taxe de cinq cents sur chaque bouteille. Plusieurs restaurants de ces villes ont également abandonné l'eau en bouteille au profit de l'eau du robinet. D'autres villes envisagent également de prendre des mesures.

"Tous les propriétaires d'animaux aiment leurs animaux de compagnie. Il n'y a pas de débat là-dessus. 
Mais lorsque nous avons demandé à nos lecteurs s'ils cloneraient leurs animaux bien-aimés, les réponses ont été divisées presque en deux. Sur les 228 lecteurs qui ont répondu, 108 cloneraient, 111 ne le feraient pas et neuf ont pesé les deux côtés sans donner d'opinion. 
Il est clair, d'après la réponse des lecteurs, qu'il s'agit d'un problème qui touche profondément à la fois la joie et  _______. Il témoigne également des attentes très différentes des gens concernant la procédure scientifique en développement.
La plupart des répondants qui étaient en faveur de l'idée étaient convaincus qu'elle produirait au moins une copie proche de l'original ; beaucoup pensaient que le processus permettrait de créer une copie exacte. Cependant, ceux de l'autre côté n'avaient que peu d'espoir qu'un clone ne pourrait jamais vraiment recréer un animal de compagnie, beaucoup ne souhaitaient tout simplement pas aller à l'encontre de la loi naturelle de la vie et de la mort.
Les deux camps ont exprimé le même amour pour leurs animaux. Plus d'un répondant possédait « le meilleur chien/chat au monde ». Ils pensaient à leurs animaux de compagnie comme à leur « meilleur ami », « un membre de la famille », « la lumière de ma vie ». Ils ont raconté des histoires émouvantes de l'héroïsme, de l'intelligence et du dévouement désintéressé de leurs animaux de compagnie.

"C'était un vieil homme qui pêchait seul dans un bateau dans le Gulf Stream et il y avait maintenant quatre-vingt-quatre jours qu'il n'avait pas pris de poisson. Pendant les quarante premiers jours, un garçon l'avait accompagné. Mais après quarante jours sans poisson, les parents du garçon lui avaient dit que le vieil homme était maintenant définitivement et finalement salao, ce qui est la pire forme de malchance, et le garçon était parti sur ordre dans un autre bateau qui avait pris trois bons poissons la première semaine. Cela rendait le garçon triste de voir le vieil homme arriver chaque jour avec sa chaloupe vide et il descendait toujours pour l'aider à porter soit les lignes enroulées, soit l'épuisette et le harpon, soit la voile qui était enroulée autour du mât. La voile était rapiécée avec des sacs de farine et, enroulée, elle ressemblait au drapeau de la défaite permanente. 
Le vieil homme était maigre et émacié, avec de profondes rides à la nuque. Les taches brunes du cancer de la peau que le soleil apporte de son reflet sur la mer tropicale étaient sur ses joues. Les taches descendaient bien le long des côtés de son visage et ses mains portaient les profondes cicatrices de la manipulation de gros poissons sur les cordes. Mais aucune de ces cicatrices n'était fraîche. Elles étaient aussi vieilles que les érosions dans un désert sans poisson. 
Tout chez lui était vieux, sauf ses yeux et ils étaient de la même couleur que la mer et étaient joyeux et non vaincus.

"Il peut sembler difficile de retracer l'histoire du rap, bien que vous voyiez souvent la musique informelle associée à un style de danse très informel. En ce qui concerne l'origine du rap, la plupart des gens s'accordent à dire qu'il provient de la culture de rue afro-américaine et latino de New York. Non seulement dans cette ville, mais aussi dans les régions environnantes, on retrouve l'influence des peuples africains et de leur culture.

Le rap est un style vocal dans lequel l'interprète parle rythmiquement et en rimes, généralement sur un rythme. Le terme de musique rap est le même que celui de musique hip-hop, qui se caractérise généralement par un style vocal rythmique appelé rap. Si on y regarde de plus près, on remarque que la musique est généralement chantée sur des tons plus élevés. La plupart du temps, la musique rap est associée à un refrain. Bien que le rap ait été à l'origine un style musical américain avec une influence africaine sur sa musique et ses paroles, il s'est récemment répandu dans presque le monde entier.

Il n'y a presque aucun pays ou nation où l'on ne trouve pas de rap sous une forme ou une autre, et c'est l'un des styles musicaux les plus populaires parmi les jeunes. Cependant, en ce qui concerne son histoire, on pense que le hip-hop ou le rap est né au début des années 1970 et a gagné en popularité dans le monde entier à la fin des années 1970 et au début des années 1980.

L'histoire du rap et du hip-hop est pleine de controverses et d'interdictions, car les paroles évoquent parfois la drogue et le crime ; même les stars du pop et les musiciens et chanteurs de hip-hop les plus célèbres se sont retrouvés associés à des controverses dans leur vie. C'est pourquoi, aussi populaire que ce style musical ait été ou soit encore, il a toujours eu une mauvaise réputation aux yeux de la société dominante.

"Mo Yan, le premier lauréat du prix Nobel de littérature né et vivant en Chine, a déclaré avoir des difficultés avec la publicité soudaine qui l'a mis sous pression. ""J'espère seulement pouvoir retourner à mon bureau d'écriture le plus tôt possible, et j'aimerais également bien faire dans la société anonymement"", a déclaré Mo Yan. Il était ennuyé par un grand nombre de demandes lui demandant d'offrir son aide en profitant de sa célébrité. ""J'étais contrarié les premiers jours après l'annonce du prix, mais j'ai ensuite réalisé que le prix est comme un miroir qui reflète diverses attitudes à propos de ma victoire, et plus encore, reflète le vrai moi"", a déclaré Mo Yan. ""Je me considère toujours comme un citoyen ordinaire qui écrit. Et présenter des œuvres de qualité est mon devoir et la meilleure façon de rendre service à la société. Je ne suis pas une superstar"", a-t-il insisté à plusieurs reprises.

Mo Yan pense que la littérature chinoise a beaucoup accompli au cours des trente dernières années, et que la force motrice de ce progrès n'est pas le prix. Les créations des écrivains ne doivent pas être motivées par des récompenses, des critiques ou les attentes des lecteurs. Mo Yan a déclaré avoir mal compris les critères de sélection de l'académie avant de se rendre à Stockholm pour recevoir le prix en décembre.

""Je pensais qu'ils jugeaient la personnalité ou les caractéristiques politiques des auteurs, puis j'ai appris que le seul critère de leur sélection était la littérature elle-même, qui est également profondément ancrée dans la pratique de longue date des Suédois de lire un grand nombre de livres"", a déclaré Mo Yan.

Au cours du forum, des écrivains chinois et australiens reconnus ont discuté de sujets aussi divers que la tradition et la modernité, le local et l'universel, et l'inclusion culturelle. Ils se sont également lus des œuvres les uns aux autres et aux lecteurs. La communication entre les écrivains permettra de promouvoir davantage les écrivains chinois auprès d'un public mondial.

"Joey est loyal, encourageant et altruiste, mettant toujours les intérêts des autres avant les siens. C'est un travailleur acharné qui adore également courir et jouer. En bref, c'est un ami idéal et un personnage héroïque.

Voici le hic : Joey est un cheval, qui apparaît comme le personnage principal dans le nouveau film de Steven Spielberg, Cheval de Guerre.

Il est basé sur le roman de Michael Morpurgo de 1982, qui a également donné lieu à une pièce de théâtre du même nom récompensée par un Tony Award.

Le film suit la saga de Joey, un cheval de course dressé pour le travail à la ferme sous les soins attentionnés d'Albert (Jeremy Irvine) après que le père ivre d'Albert, Ted (Peter Mullan), a payé trop cher l'animal aux enchères.

Puis la Première Guerre mondiale sépare Albert et Joey. Joey est vendu à l'effort de guerre britannique et commence ses aventures épisodiques en Europe.

Splendidement mis en scène, les trames de bataille du film sont visuellement impressionnantes.

Et avec la direction unique et de premier ordre de Spielberg et ses talents de conteur, Cheval de Guerre ne peut échapper à sa nature épisodique, rappelant un autre film de Spielberg sur les horreurs de la guerre et ses effets sur les soldats et les civils - Il faut sauver le soldat Ryan.

Alors que ce film choquait par ses scènes horribles de saignements, il s'appuyait sur une compagnie de personnages facilement décrits et une intrigue concentrée pour présenter des thèmes héroïques.

Comme Il faut sauver le soldat Ryan, Cheval de Guerre s'accroche à une série de personnages, non seulement Albert, mais aussi des officiers britanniques, des civils français et des soldats allemands, qui font preuve de courage face au danger. Tous ceux qui entrent en contact avec Joey sont déjà en contact avec leur ange intérieur ou sont rapidement amenés à devenir plus humains.

Bien que rien de tout cela ne cache le fait que nous avons déjà vu cela ailleurs, le sentiment charmant vous touchera.

Et la signature émotionnelle de Spielberg peut être ressentie alors qu'il établit la relation entre le garçon et le cheval et l'ambiance de l'œuvre - il y aura des larmes.

Par conséquent, appeler ce film magnifique, dramatiquement incomplet ""Sauver le soldat Joey"", est entièrement justifiable.

"Il existe de nombreuses règles scolaires dans le monde. Par exemple, en Australie, au Canada, au Japon et aux États-Unis, les élèves doivent porter des uniformes et ne sont pas autorisés à porter des boucles d'oreilles.

Certaines écoles au Japon et dans d'autres pays ont des règles concernant les cheveux. Par exemple, les élèves ne sont pas autorisés à changer la couleur de leurs cheveux. Aux États-Unis, les garçons ne peuvent pas laisser pousser leurs cheveux.

Pour des raisons de sécurité dans certaines écoles américaines, les élèves doivent avoir une paire de chaussures d'intérieur à l'école tous les jours. Cela permet de s'assurer que les élèves ne tomberont pas sur les sols mouillés et de maintenir la propreté des écoles.

La mastication de chewing-gum n'est pas autorisée dans de nombreux bâtiments scolaires américains, car elle est difficile à nettoyer. Et si les élèves mâchent du chewing-gum en classe, ils risquent de ne pas prêter beaucoup attention à leurs études.

"""Mesdames et Messieurs, nous l'avons !"" 

Avec ces mots, Paul Bremer, l'administrateur américain en chef en Irak, a annoncé au monde la capture de Saddam Hussein. 

Saddam a été retrouvé samedi soir dernier, se cachant dans un trou sur la propriété de son ancien cuisinier. Il avait une arme à feu sur lui lorsqu'il a été trouvé par des soldats américains, mais il ne l'a pas utilisée. Il avait également 750 000 dollars américains. ""Il a été assez coopératif. Aucun tir n'a été tiré"", a déclaré Richardo Sanchez, le plus haut responsable de l'armée américaine en Irak. 

Saddam Hussein a dirigé l'Irak de 1979 à avril 2003. En 1990, il est allé en guerre contre le Koweït, l'un des voisins de l'Irak. L'armée irakienne a tué de nombreux Kurdes vivant dans le pays. Les États-Unis et d'autres pays ont déclaré la guerre à l'Irak en 1991 pour faire sortir l'armée irakienne du Koweït. La guerre a été rapidement remportée par l'armée dirigée par les Américains. Mais Saddam a été laissé libre de diriger l'Irak. 

En 2003, l'Amérique a déclaré que l'Irak possédait des armes de destruction massive et a décidé de déclarer à nouveau la guerre à Saddam. 

L'armée dirigée par les États-Unis a occupé l'Irak en avril. Mais ils n'ont pas pu trouver Saddam. Saddam avait environ 30 cachettes dans le pays et il se déplaçait entre elles toutes les quatre heures. L'armée dirigée par les États-Unis ne l'a trouvé qu'après avoir été informé de sa localisation par l'un de ses anciens employés. 

L'Amérique et la Grande-Bretagne veulent maintenant juger Saddam pour ""crimes de guerre"", tels que le massacre de Kurdes dans les années 1990. 

George W. Bush, le président américain, souhaite que Saddam ""paie la peine ultime"" pour ces crimes. Par là, il entend la peine de mort. Les Nations unies et les pays européens, cependant, ne veulent pas que Saddam soit exécuté.

"L'Organisation mondiale de la santé signale que plusieurs personnes sont décédées du virus Ebola en Afrique centrale au cours des derniers mois. Ebola, également connu sous le nom de fièvre hémorragique Ebola ou maladie à virus Ebola, est une maladie rare et mortelle avec des taux de mortalité élevés chez les humains et les primates. La source naturelle du virus Ebola reste inconnue, bien que les chauves-souris semblent être la source la plus probable.

Le virus Ebola a commencé à se propager après la découverte de victimes dans le nord-est du Gabon. Jusqu'à présent, c'est la troisième fois qu'Ebola se propage au Gabon depuis 1994. Les responsables de la santé pensent que les personnes se déplaçant de l'autre côté de la frontière ont propagé la maladie du Gabon au Congo. Ebola est hautement contagieux et tue jusqu'à 80 % de ses victimes. Les chercheurs ne connaissent pas la méthode par laquelle le virus apparaît pour la première fois chez l'homme, mais ils pensent que c'est par le biais d'animaux infectés. La maladie se propage ensuite de personne à personne par le sang et d'autres liquides corporels.

Les victimes d'Ebola traitées précocement ont une chance de survie de base. Les signes d'Ebola comprennent une température élevée, une diarrhée, des douleurs musculaires et des saignements internes. Dans les cas graves, les victimes souffrent de douleurs thoraciques et de décès. Il n'existe pas de remède connu pour la maladie et aucun moyen de la prévenir pour le moment.

Des scientifiques des National Institutes of Health américains travaillent au développement d'un vaccin pour prévenir Ebola. Le Dr Cary Nobel dirige les efforts de recherche au centre de test N-I-H dans l'État oriental du Maryland. Il affirme qu'au cours des deux dernières années, le vaccin a été testé sur de petits animaux et des singes pour sa sécurité et son efficacité.

Dans la dernière étude, quatre singes ayant reçu le vaccin ont été complètement protégés d'une injection mortelle du virus Ebola. L'étude a été décrite en novembre dans la revue Nature. Le Dr Nobel affirme que les tests semblent avoir rapproché les scientifiques d'un vaccin pour les humains.

"""Comment s'appelle notre voisin ? Je ne me souviens plus. "" Avez-vous déjà entendu vos grands-parents poser des questions comme celle-ci parfois ? Généralement, on pense que la mémoire des personnes âgées devient mauvaise parce que leur cerveau faiblit. Mais une équipe de scientifiques de l'université de Tübingen en Allemagne a une nouvelle idée.

""Le cerveau humain travaille plus lentement en vieillissant,"" explique Michael Ramscar, le scientifique en chef. ""Mais uniquement parce qu'il a stocké plus d'informations au fil du temps.""

Les résultats sont basés sur une série de simulations informatiques de l'apprentissage et de la mémoire. Les scientifiques ont laissé les ordinateurs lire un certain nombre de mots et apprendre de nouvelles choses chaque jour. Lorsque l'ordinateur ""lit"" uniquement un certain volume, ses performances aux tests cognitifs sont similaires à celles d'un jeune adulte. Mais si l'ordinateur apprend les expériences que nous pouvons rencontrer au cours d'une vie, ses performances sont similaires à celles d'un adulte âgé.

Souvent, il est plus lent, mais pas parce que sa capacité de traitement a décliné. Plutôt, une ""expérience"" accrue a fait que la base de données de l'ordinateur s'est développée, lui donnant plus de données à traiter - ce qui prend du temps. C'est similaire aux personnes âgées.

"Au nom du Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT), je tiens à vous remercier d'avoir économisé l'électricité pendant cette période de chaleur et de sécheresse continue au Texas.

Chez ERCOT, nous travaillons sans relâche pour maintenir le flux d'électricité, en nous assurant que vous disposez des ressources nécessaires pour rester productifs et bien portants cet été. Bien que nous ayons toujours pour mission de vous garantir un approvisionnement électrique adéquat, cet été a posé un défi particulièrement sérieux au réseau électrique.

En raison de la chaleur qui s'est maintenue sur l'ensemble de l'État, avec peu ou pas de pluie ni de couverture nuageuse, la tension sur le réseau électrique a été plus importante que jamais. À Dallas et à Austin, nous battons des records de chaleur à trois chiffres. Nous avons atteint trois pics de demande historiques au cours des deux dernières semaines seulement, ce qui signifie que nous avons consommé plus d'électricité pendant trois jours cet été que n'importe quel autre jour de l'histoire d'ERCOT, qui couvre la majeure partie du Texas.

De plus, le Texas connaît une croissance économique et démographique alors que la majeure partie du reste du pays ne connaît pas cette croissance. Tous ces facteurs contribuent à une très forte consommation d'énergie cet été.

Comme vous l'avez probablement lu dans votre journal ou vu aux informations, ERCOT a lancé des appels à la conservation dans tout l'État en août. Nous avons encouragé les entreprises et les clients résidentiels à nous aider à économiser l'électricité entre les heures critiques de 15 h et 19 h.

Par exemple, éteindre les lumières, les appareils électroménagers et les équipements électroniques inutiles peut aider à améliorer considérablement la situation.

Les efforts de conservation nous aident à éviter les coupures de courant rotatives à l'échelle de l'État et à maintenir vos lumières allumées et vos climatiseurs en marche. La conservation permet non seulement de maintenir le courant et l'air frais pour tous les citoyens, mais aussi de garantir un flux d'électricité ininterrompu aux clients des soins critiques, qui sont facilement touchés par la chaleur extrême.

Bien qu'ERCOT n'ait pas appelé à des coupures de courant rotatives cet été, il est important de rappeler que nous ne procédons à ces coupures ordonnées et temporaires que pour éviter un effondrement catastrophique du réseau électrique. Comme vous vous en souvenez peut-être de la panne de courant du Nord-Est il y a quelques années, une fois qu'une panne de réseau survient, il peut falloir des jours pour rétablir le courant pour tous les consommateurs. Vos efforts de conservation nous aident à éviter que cela ne se produise.

Bien qu'ERCOT dispose toujours de réserves, notre approvisionnement en électricité n'est pas illimité. Cependant, avec votre aide et vos efforts de conservation, nous pouvons maintenir les résidents et les entreprises en bonne santé et productifs cet été.

"Les enfants qui reçoivent une éducation spécialisée sont, sans aucun doute, les enfants qui travaillent le plus dur dans n'importe quelle école. Lorsqu'ils ont des difficultés à apprendre les bases de la lecture et des nombres, lorsqu'ils enfreignent les règles, lorsqu'ils ont besoin de plus de services, de soutien et d'attention d'un adulte que leurs pairs, alors ils sont ceux qui luttent le plus. En psychologie, nous sommes formés pour penser que si nous nous sentons en colère ou confus lorsque nous sommes assis avec un patient, alors nous ressentons probablement ce que notre patient ressent. Il en va de même pour les élèves en situation de handicap. Tout ce que nous ressentons lorsque nous travaillons avec eux, ils le ressentent probablement lorsqu'ils travaillent avec nous.

Si vous avez un handicap qui affecte votre éducation, alors vous avez un trouble cérébral. Parce que l'éducation, même en mathématiques, est largement verbale, la plupart des troubles cérébraux responsables des handicaps éducatifs affectent le langage et la façon dont vous traitez les mots et les idées sous forme écrite et orale. Pour imaginer l'effort qu'un enfant ayant un handicap du langage dépense chaque jour d'école, imaginez-vous assister à une école aujourd'hui enseignée dans une langue que vous comprenez un peu. Imaginez cependant que, bien que vous puissiez paraître fluide aux yeux des autres, vous avez des difficultés lorsque les gens parlent trop vite, utilisent des idiomes ou des expressions.

Lorsque les adultes et les camarades de classe blâment ou critiquent les enfants qui reçoivent une éducation spécialisée, ils luttent contre leur propre confusion. Il est difficile d'imaginer le monde tel qu'il est vécu par une personne ayant un handicap éducatif. Il est difficile de comprendre comment quelqu'un qui peut être si ""normal"" peut avoir autant de problèmes.

"Depuis le début de l'histoire humaine, les animaux sauvages ont fourni de la nourriture, des vêtements et parfois des médicaments. Nous ne dépendons peut-être plus autant des animaux sauvages aujourd'hui, mais nous en entendons parler tous les jours. Les Américains utilisent les noms d'animaux de nombreuses façons. Les constructeurs automobiles et les compagnies pétrolières aiment particulièrement utiliser les grands félins pour vendre leurs produits. Ils aiment les lions, les tigres et les chats sauvages. Quand les Américains disent ""chat sauvage"", ils veulent généralement dire ""_"". Tous ces félins attaquent rapidement et férocement. Les chats sauvages représentent donc quelque chose de rapide et de féroce.
Une des premières utilisations américaines du mot ""chat sauvage"" était assez différente. Il était utilisé pour décrire les membres du Congrès qui ont déclaré la guerre à la Grande-Bretagne en 1812. Un magazine de cette année-là a déclaré que les membres du Congrès ""chats sauvages"" étaient rentrés chez eux. Il a déclaré qu'ils étaient incapables d'assumer la responsabilité d'avoir impliqué leur pays dans une guerre inutile.
Le mot ""chat sauvage"" a également été utilisé comme nom pour l'argent dans les années 1800. À cette époque, certains États autorisaient les banques à créer leur propre monnaie. Une banque de l'État du Michigan a proposé de la monnaie papier avec l'image d'un chat sauvage dessus. Certaines banques, cependant, n'avaient pas assez d'or pour financer tout le papier-monnaie qu'elles proposaient. L'argent avait donc peu ou pas de valeur. On l'appelait un billet de banque sauvage. Les banques qui proposaient cet argent étaient appelées banques sauvages. Un journal de l'époque disait que c'était l'époque de la monnaie sauvage. Il disait qu'un homme pouvait être riche le matin et pauvre le soir. 
Le mot « wildcat » était également utilisé pour désigner un puits de pétrole ou une mine d'or qui ne contenait presque pas de pétrole ou d'or. Des promoteurs malhonnêtes achetaient ce type de propriété, la vendaient ensuite et quittaient la ville avec l'argent. Les acheteurs se retrouvaient avec des trous sans valeur dans le sol. Aujourd'hui, les puits de pétrole sauvages se trouvent dans des zones qui ne sont pas connues pour contenir du pétrole.","{

"Mexico, située sur un plateau intérieur entouré de pics volcaniques, fait de la qualité de l'air une préoccupation constante pour ses habitants.
En avril, le pays a franchi une étape décisive vers l'amélioration de la qualité de l'air en promulguant une interdiction temporaire des véhicules privés et fédéraux dans la ville. La règle interdit aux gens de conduire dans la ville un jour par semaine et un samedi par mois. Les véhicules électriques, les véhicules de service public, les transports en commun et les autobus scolaires ne sont pas inclus dans l'interdiction.
Mexico n'est pas le premier centre urbain à s'engager dans une vie sans voiture. Mais l'interdiction est bien plus qu'un outil de sensibilisation ; elle a été promulguée dans le but direct de résoudre la pollution atmosphérique. En mars, la ville s'est enfoncée dans un épais brouillard brun lorsque les niveaux de pollution ont dépassé la barre des 200. La ville a ordonné à environ 1,1 million des 4,7 millions de voitures de la région de rester au garage et a également offert des trajets gratuits en bus et en métro.
L'interdiction temporaire des véhicules à Mexico soulève des questions sur les meilleures façons d'améliorer la qualité de l'air urbain. L'Inde, dont les citoyens respirent l'un des airs les plus pollués au monde, a essayé une variété de solutions. Plus tôt cette année, le gouvernement indien a instauré une taxe de vente de 4% sur les achats de voitures neuves.
Pékin a également de l'expérience dans le nettoyage de l'air. La ville a introduit des règles d'alternance journalière en prévision des Jeux olympiques de 2008, ce qui a produit des résultats positifs, mais de courte durée. Le lendemain de la mise en place des restrictions d'utilisation des véhicules, le bleu a retrouvé sa teinte grise. Et puis il y a la taxe de congestion de Londres, introduite en 2003. La taxe a eu un effet mesurable sur la qualité de l'air.
Pour l'instant, Mexico, désignée par les Nations unies comme la ville la plus polluée de la planète en 1992, peut se réjouir du début de la saison des pluies de la région, lorsque les averses quotidiennes contribueront à purifier l'air.

J'avais attendu ça toute la journée, alors j'ai tendu la main pour la prendre dès qu'il a mis les pieds dans la maison. Furieux, il a jeté l'enveloppe sur la table et a dit que ce n'était rien de bien excitant, juste un bout de papier. Je l'ai prise et je suis monté en courant. Je me demandais pourquoi mon père ne comprenait pas à quel point j'étais impatient de voir mon bulletin scolaire de mi-année pour ma première année au collège. J'étais vraiment blessé par le fait qu'il refusait de reconnaître tout mon travail acharné.

J'ai vu ma note de classe : Premier. Je n'en croyais pas mes yeux. J'ai souri et j'ai eu envie de courir en bas pour le dire à tout le monde. Puis je me suis souvenu de ce que mon père avait dit : ce n'était rien de bien excitant. Je voulais partager mon bonheur avec quelqu'un, mais je me sentais seul.

J'ai réalisé que je m'étais éloigné de ma famille. Nous avions l'habitude de rester éveillés tard pour regarder des films Disney, et mes frères, sœurs et moi jouions au tennis dans la cour toute la journée. Je me suis demandé quand tout cela s'était arrêté. J'avais simplement cessé d'y participer. J'ai passé tout mon temps à étudier.

Alors que j'étais absorbé par mes études, j'avais aussi bâti un mur entre moi et ma famille.

Je voulais simplement devenir quelqu'un dont tout le monde pourrait être fier. Je voulais descendre, m'excuser de mon comportement grossier, de chaque film et chaque partie de tennis refusés, et faire à nouveau partie de ma famille. Je savais que je devais faire quelque chose, car sans leur soutien, ma réussite ne signifiait rien.

"(1) Liu Xiang a remporté une autre médaille d'or au 110 mètres haies aux Jeux de l'Asie de l'Est (EAG) à Macao mercredi dernier. 
Le coureur de 22 ans a défendu son titre EAG en 13,21 secondes, battant Shi Dongpeng (13,36) et le Japonais Kota Kumamoto (13,89). 
Son temps de victoire était de 0,16 seconde derrière son meilleur temps de l'année et de 0,08 seconde derrière le meilleur temps de la saison : 12,97 établi par le Français Ladji Doucoure, qui avait battu Liu à la deuxième place aux championnats du monde.

La communauté internationale a répondu à l'appel à l'aide des pays. La Chine a envoyé une équipe de secours, ainsi que de l'argent et du matériel d'aide.

"Sudha Chandran, une célèbre danseuse indienne, a dû se faire amputer de la jambe droite après un accident de voiture. Sa carrière a été brutalement interrompue. 

Bien que l'accident ait mis un terme à sa carrière prometteuse, elle n'a pas abandonné. Dans les mois douloureux qui ont suivi, Sudha a rencontré un médecin qui a développé une jambe artificielle pour elle. Elle voulait tellement reprendre la danse. Sudha croyait en elle et pensait pouvoir réaliser son rêve.

Après chaque récital public, elle demandait à son père ce qu'il pensait de sa performance. ""Tu as encore beaucoup de chemin à parcourir"" était la réponse qu'elle recevait. En janvier 1984, Sudha a fait un retour historique en donnant un récital public à Bombay. Elle s'est produite de manière si exceptionnelle que tout le monde a été ému aux larmes. Ce soir-là, lorsqu'elle a posé la question habituelle à son père, il n'a rien dit. Il s'est simplement agenouillé et a touché ses pieds en signe de louange. Le retour de Sudha était si émouvant qu'un producteur de cinéma a décidé de faire de son histoire un film à succès.

Lorsque quelqu'un a demandé à Sudha comment elle avait réussi à danser à nouveau, elle a répondu avec simplicité : ""On n'a pas besoin de pieds pour danser."" Rien n'est impossible dans ce monde. Si vous avez la volonté de gagner, vous pouvez tout accomplir.

"Je savais que j'allais bien maintenant. Personne d'autre ne viendrait me chasser. J'ai sorti mes pièges du canot et j'ai fait un beau campement dans les bois épais. J'ai fait une tente avec mes couvertures pour mettre mes affaires à l'abri de la pluie. J'ai pêché un poisson-chat et vers le coucher du soleil, j'ai allumé mon feu de camp et j'ai mangé.

Quand il a fait nuit, je me suis assis près de mon feu de camp, me sentant assez satisfait ; mais peu à peu, j'ai commencé à me sentir un peu seul, alors je suis allé m'asseoir sur la berge et j'ai écouté le courant qui se brisait sur les rochers, et j'ai compté les étoiles, les troncs d'arbres et les radeaux qui descendaient, puis je me suis couché ; il n'y avait pas de meilleur moyen de _ lorsque vous êtes seul ; vous ne pouvez pas rester ainsi, et vous finissez par vous en remettre.

Et ainsi pendant trois jours et trois nuits. Pas de différence – toujours la même chose. Mais le lendemain, j'ai exploré l'île. J'en étais le maître ; elle m'appartenait entièrement, et je voulais tout savoir sur elle ; mais surtout, je voulais passer le temps. J'ai trouvé beaucoup de fraises et de raisins verts d'été ; et les mûres vertes commençaient à apparaître.

Eh bien, j'ai continué à flâner dans les bois profonds jusqu'à ce que je juge que je n'étais pas loin du pied de l'île. J'avais mon fusil avec moi, mais je n'avais rien tiré ; c'était pour me protéger. À ce moment-là, j'ai failli marcher sur un serpent de bonne taille, et il s'est déplacé tranquillement et doucement à travers l'herbe et les fleurs, et je l'ai poursuivi, essayant de lui tirer dessus. J'ai couru, et tout à coup, je suis tombé sur les cendres d'un feu de camp qui fumait encore.

Mon cœur a sauté dans ma gorge. Je n'ai pas attendu pour regarder plus loin, mais j'ai déverrouillé mon fusil et je me suis faufilé en arrière sur la pointe des pieds aussi vite que possible. De temps en temps, je m'arrêtais une seconde parmi les feuilles épaisses et j'écoutais, mais ma respiration était si forte que je ne pouvais rien entendre d'autre. Je me suis déplacé tranquillement un peu plus loin, puis j'ai écouté à nouveau ; et ainsi de suite, et ainsi de suite. Si je voyais une souche, je la prenais pour un homme ; si je marchais sur un bâton et que je le cassais, j'avais l'impression qu'une personne avait coupé l'une de mes respirations en deux et que je n'en avais reçu que la moitié, et la moitié la plus courte aussi.

Il n'y avait pas de temps à perdre. En arrivant au campement, j'ai remis tous mes pièges dans mon canot afin de les cacher. J'ai éteint le feu et j'ai répandu les cendres autour pour que cela ressemble à un vieux campement de l'année dernière, puis j'ai grimpé dans un arbre.

Je suppose que j'y suis resté pendant deux heures ; mais je n'ai rien vu ni entendu – j'ai seulement pensé avoir entendu et vu mille choses. Eh bien, je ne pouvais pas rester là-haut éternellement, alors finalement je suis descendu, mais je suis resté dans les bois épais et j'ai gardé un œil sur tout. Tout ce que je pouvais manger, c'étaient des baies et ce qui restait du petit déjeuner.

"J'ai regardé mon magnifique sapin de Noël et j'ai soupiré. C'était le moment. La nouvelle année était vieille d'une semaine et mon arbre était toujours debout dans le coin de notre chambre, sa collection de souvenirs fièrement exposée dans une pluie de lumières colorées. J'avais assez procrastiné.

Je me suis levé, suis allé au garage et j'ai traîné toutes les boîtes dans la pièce. La guirlande a été la première à être retirée. L'arbre avait déjà l'air nu. J'ai ensuite enlevé la grosse boule. Elles formaient une grosse pile sur notre lit. Une heure plus tard, notre lit était couvert de souvenirs de Noël. Chaque pile contenait une boule et ses sœurs jumelles, provenant de collections achetées il y a de nombreuses années.

J'ai préparé les boîtes et j'ai soigneusement placé les boules dans leur emballage protecteur, m'arrêtant toutes les quelques minutes pour admirer une de mes préférées. ""Hé, petit Père Noël !"" J'ai tenu le Père Noël de mon enfance. ""Merci d'être mon ami depuis près de cinquante ans."" Il était un peu râpé, mais il me procure toujours une vague de souvenirs merveilleux. ""À l'année prochaine, mon cher ami.""

Il y avait une collection de boules faites à la main. Mes enfants les avaient faites pendant leurs premières années d'école, il y a plus de vingt ans. Fabriquées par de petites mains, elles sont loin d'être parfaites dans leur conception, mais chaque année, elles sont placées sur mon arbre à souvenirs, souvenirs de jeunes rires le matin de Noël et d'un visage souriant quand ils me les ont remises en rentrant du travail. ""Regarde ce qu'on a fait, Papa !""

""Oh ! C'est magnifique. Trouvons-lui une place spéciale sur l'arbre."" Chaque année depuis, elles sont exposées.

Quelques heures après avoir commencé, les boîtes remplies étaient de retour au garage, la pièce était aspirée et j'étais assis à regarder un coin vide. La pièce semblait si vide. Il m'a fallu deux jours de travail pour assembler et décorer mon arbre, mais seulement quelques heures pour le démonter.

Mon arbre est comme un bon mariage ou une grande amitié. Comme l'arbre, ils prennent beaucoup de temps à assembler et à décorer avec des souvenirs, mais peuvent être démontés rapidement.

Chaque année, je dois ranger mon arbre, mais pas mon mariage ni mes amitiés. Je prends grand soin de celles-ci. Elles peuvent briller dans un coin de ma vie aussi longtemps que je vivrai. Je peux analyser mon arbre et retrouver des souvenirs pendant quelques semaines chaque année. Je peux faire de même avec les amours de ma vie tous les jours. Prenez grand soin de vos amitiés et de votre mariage. Une fois qu'ils sont descendus, ils ne sont pas aussi faciles à remonter qu'un sapin de Noël. Placez-les dans cet endroit spécial dans le coin de votre cœur et admirez leur éclat.

"Vous êtes probablement au courant des tendances de base. Les récompenses financières de l'éducation ont augmenté au cours des dernières décennies, mais les hommes n'en profitent pas.

Au primaire et au secondaire, les résultats scolaires des garçons sont à la traîne. Les garçons obtiennent les trois quarts des D et des F. Au collège, les hommes sont clairement en retard. Seuls 40 % des diplômes de licence sont décernés aux hommes, ainsi que 40 % des maîtrises.

En raison de leurs compétences plus faibles, les hommes quittent le marché du travail. En 1954, 96 % des hommes américains âgés de 25 à 54 ans travaillaient. Aujourd'hui, ce chiffre est tombé à 80 %. Dans le rapport sur l'emploi de vendredi, la participation des hommes à la population active a atteint un niveau historiquement bas.

Des millions d'hommes perçoivent des allocations d'invalidité. Même parmi ceux qui ont un emploi, beaucoup se débattent. Selon Michael Greenstone du Hamilton Project, les revenus annuels des hommes d'âge moyen ont diminué de 28 % au cours des 40 dernières années.

Les hommes dominent toujours le sommet de l'échelle hiérarchique des entreprises parce que beaucoup de femmes prennent un congé pour élever leurs enfants, mais les femmes mènent ou gagnent du terrain presque partout ailleurs. Les femmes dans la vingtaine gagnent plus que les hommes dans la vingtaine. Douze des 15 professions à la croissance la plus rapide sont dominées par les femmes.

Au fil des ans, beaucoup d'entre nous ont utilisé une certaine théorie pour expliquer le déclin économique des hommes. Il s'agit du fait que l'économie de l'ère de l'information récompense des qualités que les femmes sont plus susceptibles de posséder.

Pour réussir aujourd'hui, il faut être capable de s'asseoir et de se concentrer à l'école dès son plus jeune âge. Il faut être sensible émotionnellement et conscient du contexte. Il faut communiquer en douceur. Pour des raisons génétiques et culturelles, beaucoup d'hommes ne sont pas doués pour cela.

Mais dans son nouveau livre fascinant, The End of Men, Hanna Rosin propose une théorie différente. Elle a trait à l'adaptabilité. Les femmes, soutient Rosin, sont comme des immigrés qui ont déménagé dans un nouveau pays. Elles voient un nouveau contexte social et s'adaptent de manière flexible aux nouvelles circonstances. Les hommes sont comme des immigrés qui ont déménagé physiquement dans un nouveau pays, mais qui ont gardé leur esprit dans l'ancien. Ils parlent la vieille langue. Ils suivent les vieilles coutumes. Les hommes sont plus susceptibles d'être rigides ; les femmes sont plus fluides.

Cette théorie a moins à voir avec les qualités innées et plus à voir avec la position sociale. Lorsqu'il y a un grand changement social, les personnes qui étaient au sommet du vieil ordre sont obligées de s'en tenir aux vieilles méthodes. Les personnes qui étaient au bas de l'échelle sont obligées de connaître un regain d'énergie. Elles vont explorer leur nouvel environnement avec plus d'enthousiasme.

Rosin fait des reportages dans l'Alabama ouvrier. Les femmes qu'elle rencontre se précipitent vers de nouveaux emplois et de nouvelles opportunités - retournent au collège, poursuivent de nouvelles carrières. Les hommes attendent les emplois qui restent et ne reviendront jamais. Ils sont étrangement immunisés contre les nouvelles options. Dans la région d'Auburn-Opelika, le revenu moyen des femmes est de 140 % du revenu moyen des hommes.

Rosin ne dit pas que les femmes sont gagnantes dans une guerre mondiale des sexes ou qu'elles réussissent simplement parce que les hommes vont mal. Elle dit simplement que les femmes s'adaptent à l'économie actuelle avec plus de flexibilité que les hommes. Il y a beaucoup de preuves pour appuyer son argument.

Une étude de la National Federation of Independent Business a révélé que les petites entreprises appartenant à des femmes ont surperformé les petites entreprises appartenant à des hommes pendant la dernière récession. En finance, les femmes qui changent d'entreprise sont plus susceptibles de voir leurs performances s'améliorer, tandis que les hommes sont susceptibles de voir leurs performances baisser. Il y a même des preuves que les femmes sont mieux à même de s'adapter au divorce. Aujourd'hui, plus de femmes que d'hommes voient leurs revenus augmenter de 25 % après une rupture conjugale.

Il y a quarante ans, les hommes et les femmes s'en tenaient à une certaine théorie, à ce que cela signifiait d'être un homme ou une femme. Les jeunes femmes d'aujourd'hui, soutient Rosin, ont abandonné les préconceptions féministes et pré-féministes. Les hommes s'en tiennent toujours aux règles de la masculinité, qui limitent leur vision et leur mouvement.

Si elle a raison, alors les hommes devront reconnaître qu'ils sont des étrangers dans un pays étranger.

"Une lettre de réponse est parfois un bien précieux. Voici une histoire qui raconte ce sentiment humain commun et naturel.
La femme la plus occupée du Labrador pendant un Noël glacial il n'y a pas si longtemps était une infirmière australienne nommée Kate Austen. Mais l'infirmière Austen n'était pas trop occupée pour écrire une longue lettre amicale pour chaque cadeau de nourriture ou de vêtements reçu pour les pauvres villageois du nord de l'Australie. Parmi les cadeaux, il y avait une boîte de tricot pour enfants, tricotée et envoyée par une femme de Toronto.
L'infirmière Austen, était occupée, et ne se sentait pas très bien cet hiver. Elle aurait pu écrire simplement des notes de remerciement routinières. Mais ce n'était pas sa façon de faire. Elle s'est assise et a écrit à la femme de Toronto une vraie lettre racontant tout sur le village, les noms des enfants qui portaient les mitaines et les bonnets tricotés, ce qu'ils ont dit quand ils les ont reçus et comment ils ont l'air lorsqu'ils les portaient. Elle voulait que la femme qui avait tricoté et envoyé tous ces beaux tricots ""voie combien de bonheur et de chaleur elle avait créés"". Peu de temps après, elle a reçu la réponse suivante du Canada.
Chère Mlle Austen,
Votre lettre m'a fait plaisir. Je ne m'attendais pas à un retour aussi complet, j'ai quatre-vingts ans et je suis aveugle. Il y a peu de choses que je puisse faire sauf tricoter, et c'est pourquoi je tricote autant de bonnets, de pulls et d'écharpes. Depuis soixante ans, je confectionne des colis missionnaires de vêtements, de nourriture, de médicaments ou de livres que je pouvais collecter. Mais jamais auparavant de toute ma vie, je n'avais reçu une lettre personnelle décrivant le village et me disant qui porte les vêtements et ce qu'ils ont dit. Je ne pensais pas qu'un jour de ma vie, je recevrais une lettre comme celle-là. Que Dieu vous bénisse.
Sincèrement vôtre,                                                                  Laura N. Russell

"Tout le monde a besoin d'amis. Il y a un vieux dicton qui dit ""Les amis sont la façon dont Dieu prend soin de nous."" Mais comment trouver une vraie amitié et la garder ?
L'écrivaine américaine Sally Seamans donne aux jeunes élèves quelques conseils astucieux pour se faire des amis. Sally dit que trouver l'amitié est comme planter un arbre. Vous plantez la graine et vous en prenez soin pour la faire pousser.
Tout d'abord, vous devez choisir un ami. Quels bons amis devriez-vous vous faire ? Ce n'est pas parce qu'une personne a de l'argent ou une belle apparence. Un bon ami doit être gentil et  compréhensif. Par exemple, si vous avez une mauvaise journée, un bon ami devrait écouter vos plaintes et faire de son mieux pour vous aider. Pour se faire un ami, il ne faut pas être trop timide. Vous devriez vous rendre mutuellement heureux et partager vos vies. Mais les choses ne peuvent pas toujours être heureuses. Même les meilleurs se disputent. Que devriez-vous faire lorsque vous vous disputez avec votre ami ? Vous devez lui parler. Quand il n'y a personne autour, ayez une conversation honnête. S'il ou elle ne veut pas parler, vous pouvez lui écrire une lettre.
Il y a trois étapes pour redevenir amis :
Dites-lui comment vous vous sentez ; dites ce que votre ami a fait de mal, et expliquez pourquoi vous avez fait ceci ou cela. N'oubliez pas que l'amitié est la chose la plus importante dans votre vie.

"Les codes-barres ne suscitent pas beaucoup d'attention de la part de la majorité des consommateurs, mais ces codes ont été mis en œuvre de manière fonctionnelle assez récemment, en 1970.
Un petit propriétaire de magasin d'alimentation a décidé un jour que la tenue des registres de son inventaire et des prix associés était un processus extrêmement fastidieux. En 1948, il a donc contacté l'Institut de technologie Drexel afin de trouver une solution. Bernard Sliver a relevé le défi et s'est lancé dans l'étude du problème, en commençant à travailler sur une solution impliquant un moyen automatique de suivre les articles vendus. Sliver et un groupe d'étudiants de l'institut ont trouvé la solution sous la forme de la lumière ultraviolette, de l'encre et d'un scanner.
Le système a initialement fonctionné, mais présentait certains inconvénients. Il était extrêmement coûteux à mettre en œuvre à grande échelle et le système était également instable. Si l'invention devait devenir monnaie courante dans les épiceries, ces deux problèmes devaient être résolus.
Le brevet du système de code-barres a été déposé par Sliver et l'un de ses étudiants, Woodland. Le brevet n'a pas été accordé immédiatement ; en fait, il a fallu trois ans à l'agence des brevets pour accorder leur invention, le brevet du code-barres, qui a eu lieu le 7 octobre 1952.
Malgré l'octroi du brevet, le système n'était toujours pas accueilli favorablement par la majorité des propriétaires de magasins. Ce n'est qu'en 1966 que le système a commencé à s'imposer dans de plus en plus d'épiceries. Ce système a rapidement été critiqué, car il n'existait aucun mécanisme central pour contrôler les articles codés de manière uniforme. En 1970, Logicom a développé le code d'identification universel des produits d'épicerie (UGOIC), rapidement abrégé en code d'identification universel (UPC). C'est le supermarché Marsh, à Troy, qui a été le tout premier magasin à installer ce système complexe de lecture de code-barres, et sa popularité n'a cessé de croître depuis, et il est aujourd'hui monnaie courante dans tous les types de magasins du monde entier.

"Les Britanniques sont très polis et ont de bonnes manières : ils ne se lassent jamais de dire ""Merci"", ""Je suis désolé"" ou ""Excusez-moi"". Ils ont de bonnes manières à table. Ils aiment leurs petits déjeuners et surtout le thé traditionnel vers 16h ou 17h.

La semaine de travail normale compte cinq jours. Les ouvriers d'usine commencent généralement à 8h du matin, tandis que les bureaux, les magasins et les écoles ouvrent à 9h. Les travailleurs ont 3 semaines de vacances et les travailleurs professionnels (personnes ayant une formation supérieure) ont généralement des vacances plus longues (un mois ou plus). En dehors de ces vacances, ils bénéficient de jours fériés : par exemple, le jour de l'An, le Vendredi saint, le Lundi de Pâques, le jour de Noël et le Boxing Day.

Un Anglais moyen aime vivre dans sa propre maison. Les maisons sont construites en briques rouges, en pierre et en bois. La maison compte généralement de 4 à 6 pièces, deux étages, un petit jardin à l'avant et à l'arrière. Au rez-de-chaussée se trouvent un hall, une cuisine, un salon avec cheminée et au premier étage se trouvent les chambres des parents et des enfants ainsi qu'une salle de bain. Les prix des maisons dépendent de la région : les plus chères sont les maisons de Londres et du sud de l'Angleterre (environ 200 000 livres sterling) ; les maisons plus petites dans d'autres régions peuvent coûter environ 50 000 livres sterling.

Protection sociale - Le National Health Service offre des soins largement gratuits à tous les habitants de la Grande-Bretagne. Les gens peuvent choisir leur médecin de famille. En cas d'urgence, vous pouvez appeler une ambulance en composant le 999 depuis n'importe où. Les centres de santé sont gérés par les autorités locales. Environ 7 % des hôpitaux, dentistes et médecins généralistes travaillent en privé.

Il existe environ 130 journaux quotidiens et du dimanche ainsi qu'un grand nombre de journaux et de magazines hebdomadaires. Le plus ancien journal est The Times. D'autres journaux célèbres sont le Daily Mirror, le Daily Mail, le Financial Times, etc.

"Les humains sont bien adaptés à la vie sur Terre. Mais dans l'espace, c'est différent. Une faible gravité ou une _ modifie la circulation sanguine et provoque des nausées, une perte musculaire et de la fatigue. L'apesanteur peut également entraîner une perte osseuse. Mais les scientifiques expérimentent de petits vers pour mieux comprendre comment les voyages spatiaux affectent les astronautes.

Le ver de quelques millimètres de long est appelé C. elegans. Ce ver transparent est souvent utilisé dans les études médicales car sa durée de vie est d'environ deux semaines seulement. Soixante-dix pour cent de son ADN est identique à l'ADN humain.

Sabanayagam est un scientifique qui a construit un simulateur de microgravité pour tester comment C. elegans se comporterait en apesanteur réelle.

Les scientifiques placent les vers dans le simulateur rempli d'eau. Après une semaine, ils sortent les vers. Ils recherchent des changements dans l'épigénome des vers, qui sont des marqueurs chimiques qui indiquent à l'ADN dans les cellules comment fonctionner. L'épigénome peut être modifié par l'environnement. Et ces changements se transmettent d'une génération de vers à l'autre.

""Lorsque les vers sont dans un environnement liquide, certaines marques épigénétiques persistent même lorsque l'on retire l'animal de l'environnement liquide et que l'on le remet dans des conditions terrestres normales. Ainsi, sa progéniture conserve cette mémoire épigénétique de l'environnement liquide ou de l'environnement de microgravité des parents.""

Les informations recueillies par les scientifiques suggèrent que les marques épigénétiques apparaissent au début de la vie d'un ver.

M. Sabanayagam pense que les scientifiques peuvent trouver des gènes chez l'homme similaires à ceux des vers qui ont réagi à la microgravité et que les scientifiques pourraient éventuellement observer ces gènes de près lorsque les astronautes voyagent dans l'espace.

Sabanayagam s'attend à ce que C. elegans visite la Station spatiale internationale d'ici deux ans. Il espère que les informations recueillies à partir des études sur les vers pourront servir à développer des tests simples, peu coûteux et rapides pour mesurer la santé d'un astronaute.

"Les lapins sont faciles à élever. Ils sont propres et silencieux. Ils n'ont pas besoin de beaucoup d'espace. Et leur nourriture coûte peu, mais vous pouvez obtenir un grand retour sur investissement.

Un mâle et deux femelles peuvent produire jusqu'à cinquante lapins supplémentaires en un an. C'est assez pour fournir de la viande à une famille. La viande de lapin est riche en protéines et pauvre en matières grasses.

Vous n'avez pas besoin d'être agriculteur pour élever des lapins. Vous pouvez les élever en ville.

Les clapiers sont faciles à fabriquer avec du bois et du grillage. Ils n'ont pas besoin d'être très grands. Mais chaque lapin doit avoir sa propre petite pièce dans le clapier. C'est très important. Chaque pièce doit mesurer environ 75 centimètres de large, 60 centimètres de haut et un mètre de profondeur.

Des clôtures sont utilisées pour les côtés et le sol du clapier. Les trous dans le grillage doivent mesurer environ un centimètre carré. Les déchets des animaux tomberont à travers les trous. Cela permet de garder le clapier propre et sec.

Les lapins ont besoin de beaucoup d'air frais et de soleil. Couvrez les côtés du clapier uniquement pour le protéger de la pluie.

Les lapins mangent principalement de l'herbe et des feuilles. Accrochez des contenants d'alimentation à l'extérieur du clapier pour que les lapins puissent manger quand ils le souhaitent. Ils n'ont qu'à tirer l'herbe et les feuilles à travers les trous dans la clôture.

Chaque pièce doit avoir de l'eau fraîche. Les contenants d'eau doivent être lourds pour que le lapin ne puisse pas les renverser. Ou vous pouvez attacher les contenants à la clôture.

Un mois après l'accouplement, les lapines donnent naissance à environ huit bébés. En deux mois, un lapinon doit peser environ deux kilogrammes. C'est assez gros pour faire un repas pour une petite famille.

Les lapins sont également précieux pour leur fourrure. Il faut du temps, des compétences et de l'argent pour préparer la fourrure et la peau pour l'usage. Si vous n'avez que quelques lapins, il serait probablement préférable de faire préparer la fourrure par un tanneur. Des compétences sont également nécessaires pour enlever la fourrure du lapin.

_ . Beaucoup de gens aiment garder des lapins comme animaux de compagnie amicaux. Et les déchets de lapin font un excellent engrais. Il peut être mélangé directement au sol pour améliorer la croissance des légumes, des arbres et des plantes à fleurs.

"Vous ne prêtez peut-être pas beaucoup attention à votre trajet quotidien en ascenseur. Beaucoup d'entre nous utilisent un ascenseur plusieurs fois par jour sans vraiment y penser. Mais Lee Gray, PhD, de l'Université de Caroline du Nord, aux États-Unis, s'est donné pour mission d'examiner ce mode de transport public souvent négligé. Il est connu sous le nom de ""Lift Guy"".

""L'ascenseur devient cet espace social intéressant où l'étiquette est un peu étrange"", a déclaré Gray à la BBC. ""Ils (les ascenseurs) sont socialement très intéressants mais souvent des endroits très gênants.""

Nous entrons et nous retournons généralement pour faire face à la porte. Si quelqu'un d'autre entre, nous devrons peut-être bouger. Et ici, selon Gray, les utilisateurs d'ascenseurs suivent inconsciemment un modèle de mouvements défini. Il a raconté à la BBC ce qu'il avait observé.

Il a expliqué que lorsque vous êtes le seul à l'intérieur d'un ascenseur, vous pouvez faire ce que vous voulez - c'est votre petit box.

Si vous êtes deux, vous allez dans des coins différents, debout en diagonale l'un par rapport à l'autre pour créer de la distance.

Lorsqu'une troisième personne entre, vous formerez inconsciemment un triangle. Et lorsqu'il y a une quatrième personne, cela devient un carré, avec quelqu'un dans chaque coin. Une cinquième personne devra probablement se tenir au milieu.

Les nouveaux entrants dans l'ascenseur devront évaluer la situation lorsque les portes s'ouvrent, puis agir avec décision. Une fois à l'intérieur, pour la plupart des gens, la règle est simple : regarder vers le bas ou regarder leur téléphone.

Pourquoi sommes-nous si maladroits dans les ascenseurs ?

""Vous n'avez pas assez d'espace"", a déclaré à la BBC la professeure Babette Renneberg, psychologue clinicienne à la Free University de Berlin. ""Habituellement, lorsque nous rencontrons d'autres personnes, nous avons environ un bras de distance entre nous. Et ce n'est pas possible dans la plupart des ascenseurs.""

Dans un espace aussi petit et clos, il devient très important d'agir d'une manière qui ne puisse pas être interprétée comme menaçante ou étrange. ""Le plus simple est d'éviter le contact visuel"", a-t-elle déclaré.

"Des chercheurs américains affirment que la consommation de thé pourrait aider à renforcer le système de défense de l'organisme contre les infections. Des médecins du Brigham and Women's Hospital de Boston, dans le Massachusetts, ont mené l'étude. L'équipe a étudié un produit chimique présent dans le thé noir, vert, oolong et pekoe. Ce produit chimique est un acide aminé appelé L-théanine. Les scientifiques affirment qu'il pourrait augmenter la force des cellules T gamma delta. Il s'agit de la lettre T, pas de la boisson. Les cellules T gamma delta font partie du système de défense de l'organisme.

Tout d'abord, les chercheurs ont mélangé certaines de ces cellules avec des antigènes présents dans l'acide aminé. Les antigènes aident l'organisme à réagir aux infections. Ensuite, les scientifiques ont ajouté des bactéries. En l'espace de vingt-quatre heures, les cellules ont produit une grande quantité d'interféron, une substance qui lutte contre les infections. Les cellules non mélangées avec les antigènes n'ont pas produit d'interféron.

Dans la deuxième partie de l'étude, onze personnes ont bu cinq à six tasses de thé noir chaque jour. Dix autres personnes ont bu la même quantité de café instantané. Il s'agit de café séché mélangé à de l'eau chaude.

Deux semaines plus tard, et deux semaines après cela, les chercheurs ont testé le sang des vingt et un participants. Ils ont également observé ce qui se passait lorsqu'ils ajoutaient des bactéries aux cellules sanguines. Ils ont constaté que les buveurs de thé produisaient cinq fois plus d'interféron après avoir commencé à boire du thé. Les buveurs de café n'ont pas produit d'interféron.

Le docteur Jack Bukowski a dirigé l'étude. Il affirme que les antigènes ajoutés aux cellules T gamma delta sont responsables de la réaction accrue aux bactéries. Il ajoute que l'étude a également montré que les cellules étaient capables de se souvenir des bactéries et de les combattre à nouveau la prochaine fois.

Des recherches antérieures avaient déjà montré que le thé pouvait aider à prévenir les maladies cardiaques et le cancer. Le docteur Bukowski affirme que la nouvelle étude doit être répétée sur un plus grand nombre de personnes. ""Si les résultats s'avèrent exacts"", dit-il, ""la consommation de thé pourrait également contribuer à protéger contre les infections bactériennes."" Il ajoute que l'acide aminé L-théanine pourrait être extrait du thé et utilisé comme médicament pour renforcer les défenses de l'organisme.

"De nos jours, la plupart des gens en Grande-Bretagne et aux États-Unis ne portent pas de vêtements formels. Mais il est parfois important de porter la bonne tenue. Beaucoup de Britanniques ne réfléchissent pas beaucoup aux vêtements. Lorsqu'ils sortent pour se divertir, ils peuvent porter presque n'importe quoi. Aux théâtres, aux cinémas et aux concerts, vous pouvez mettre ce que vous voulez : des costumes et des robes magnifiques aux jeans et aux pulls. Tout est permis, tant que vous avez l'air propre et soigné. Mais en Grande-Bretagne, comme aux États-Unis, les hommes de bureau portent généralement des costumes et des cravates, et les femmes portent des robes ou des jupes (pas de pantalons). Les médecins et les hommes d'affaires portent toujours des vêtements assez formels. Et dans certains hôtels et restaurants, les hommes doivent porter une cravate et les femmes doivent porter une robe soignée.
À bien des égards, les Américains sont moins formels que les Britanniques, mais ils sont plus attentifs à leurs vêtements. À la maison, la plupart des Américains portent des vêtements décontractés ou des vêtements de sport. Mais lorsqu'ils sortent le soir, ils aiment avoir l'air bien. Dans les bons hôtels et restaurants, les hommes doivent porter des vestes et des cravates, et les femmes doivent porter des vêtements élégants.
Il est difficile de dire exactement ce que les gens portent en Grande-Bretagne et aux États-Unis, car chacun est différent. Si vous ne savez pas quoi porter, observez ce que les autres font et faites de même. Vous vous sentirez bien si vous n'avez pas l'air trop différent de tout le monde.

"Demandez à la plupart des gens du monde ce qu'ils recherchent dans la vie, et la réponse sera probablement : ""être heureux"". Ed Deiner, un professeur de psychologie américain, a consacré toute sa vie professionnelle à étudier ce qui rend les gens heureux, à comparer les niveaux de bonheur entre les cultures et à essayer de comprendre exactement pourquoi nous nous amusons.
Beaucoup de gens diraient que cette question n'a pas besoin de réponse. Mais le professeur Deiner en a une quand même. ""Si vous êtes une personne joyeuse et heureuse, votre mariage a plus de chances de durer, et vous avez plus de chances de gagner de l'argent et de réussir dans votre travail. En moyenne, les personnes heureuses ont un système immunitaire plus fort, et il existe des preuves qu'elles vivent plus longtemps.""
Alors qui sont les personnes les plus heureuses du monde ? Cela dépend de la façon dont le mot est défini. Il y a le bonheur individuel, le sentiment de joie que nous ressentons lorsque nous faisons quelque chose que nous aimons. Mais il y a aussi le sentiment de satisfaction que nous ressentons lorsque nous savons que les autres nous respectent et approuvent notre comportement. Selon le professeur Deiner, le monde occidental poursuit le bonheur individuel tandis que l'Asie préfère la satisfaction mutuelle.
""En Occident, la culture individualiste signifie que votre humeur compte beaucoup plus qu'en Orient. Les gens se demandent s'ils font ce qui est amusant ou intéressant. Ils deviennent malheureux lorsqu'ils ne peuvent pas faire aucune de ces choses. Si vous demandez à des Japonais ou des Chinois s'ils sont heureux, ils ont tendance à regarder ce qui a mal tourné dans leur vie. Si pas grand-chose n'a mal tourné, alors ils sont satisfaits.""
Les Espagnols et les autres pays hispanophones ont la culture la plus heureuse, a constaté le professeur Deiner. ""La plus grande différence culturelle est liée à la fierté et à la honte. Les cultures hispaniques rapportent beaucoup plus de fierté et beaucoup moins de honte que les autres.""
Le revenu a également fait une grande différence sur le bonheur des gens, mais seulement aux niveaux les plus bas. Les personnes ayant un revenu moyen aux États-Unis étaient beaucoup plus heureuses que les personnes vivant dans la pauvreté. Mais les millionnaires n'étaient que légèrement plus heureux que les personnes ayant un revenu moyen. Il semble que l'argent nous rend heureux lorsque nous en avons assez pour nous sentir en sécurité.

"Une étude suggère que chaque heure passée à regarder la télévision, les DVD et les vidéos à l'âge adulte réduit l'espérance de vie de près de 22 minutes. Et regarder la télévision en moyenne six heures par jour peut réduire votre vie de cinq ans.

La recherche affirme qu'un mode de vie sédentaire est aussi mauvais pour la santé que le tabagisme et l'obésité, en raison des dangers liés à l'inactivité et des plus grandes opportunités qu'il offre pour une alimentation malsaine.

Les universitaires menant l'étude se sont donné pour objectif de calculer le risque global pour l'espérance de vie lié au visionnage de la télévision. Leurs recherches ont porté sur plus de 11 000 personnes âgées de plus de 25 ans.

Dans un article publié dans le British Journal of Sports Medicine, ils ont conclu : ""Le temps passé à regarder la télévision peut être associé à une perte de vie, similaire à d'autres facteurs de risque majeurs de maladies chroniques tels que l'inactivité physique et l'obésité.""

Les chercheurs, de l'Université du Queensland, ont utilisé des informations provenant de l'Australian Diabetes, Obesity and Lifestyle Study, ainsi que des données démographiques et de taux de mortalité.

Mais ils ont ajouté : ""Bien que nous ayons utilisé des données australiennes, les effets dans d'autres pays industrialisés et en développement sont probablement similaires, compte tenu du temps important consacré à regarder la télévision et des similitudes dans les schémas de maladies."" Au Royaume-Uni, le temps moyen passé à regarder la télévision est de quatre heures par jour, contre cinq heures aux États-Unis.

Plus tôt cette année, une étude distincte suggérait que le risque de développer un diabète de type 2 et une maladie cardiaque, ou de mourir prématurément, augmentait de 20 % après seulement deux heures par jour devant la télévision.

La directrice médicale en chef de l'Angleterre, Sally Davies, a déclaré : ""L'activité physique offre d'énormes avantages et ces études confirment ce que nous savons déjà, à savoir qu'un mode de vie sédentaire comporte des risques supplémentaires. Nous espérons que ces études aideront davantage de personnes à réaliser qu'il existe de nombreuses façons de faire de l'exercice.""

"Le 8 mai dernier, jeudi matin, la flamme olympique a été allumée au sommet du mont Qomolangma ! Ce fut un moment historique pour la Chine, exactement trois mois avant les Jeux de Pékin.

L'alpiniste tibétaine Cering Wangmo a atteint le sommet avec un flambeau olympique spécial conçu pour les altitudes extrêmes. Cet événement est ce que la Chine a promis au monde comme le point culminant du relais de la flamme, le plus long et le plus difficile de tous les temps.

Cinq porteurs de la flamme ont terminé le relais le plus haut jamais réalisé, trois des alpinistes étant des athlètes tibétains.

Les membres de l'équipe ont lancé un ""Pékin vous accueille !"" en chinois, en anglais et en tibétain, alors qu'ils se tenaient au sommet pour célébrer, l'événement étant diffusé à la télévision nationale.

""J'ai enfin réalisé le dernier rêve de mon mari"", a déclaré Gyigyi, les larmes aux yeux. Elle était la première porteuse de la flamme. Son mari a perdu la vie lors d'une tentative d'escalade des 14 montagnes de Chine de plus de 8 000 mètres il y a trois ans.

""Nous sommes au sommet du monde ! Un monde, un rêve"", a crié Nima Cering, à tue-tête. Il a déclaré que même s'il avait gravi le sommet à plusieurs reprises, cette ascension était la plus importante. ""En tant que Tibétain et Chinois, je prie pour le succès de Pékin 2008"", a-t-il ajouté.

Le flambeau spécial est différent de celui qui fait actuellement le tour de la Chine continentale, après un relais autour du monde. Les responsables qui organisent la randonnée jusqu'au sommet avaient initialement fixé le 26 avril comme objectif pour commencer l'ascension, mais des vents violents et de fortes chutes de neige ont retardé la mission.

L'agence de presse Xinhua a déclaré que l'ascension du Qomolangma du relais de la flamme représente la devise olympique, ""plus haut, plus vite, plus fort"", dans la pratique et permettra de promouvoir l'unité entre les 56 groupes ethniques de Chine.

"TOKYO, JAPON -- Que faites-vous lorsque vous voyez un cafard ? Le frappez-vous avec un journal ? Le piétinez-vous ? 
Lorsque des chercheurs de l'Université de Tokyo voient un cafard, ils prennent la télécommande et le font tourner, courir à gauche ou à droite, ou avancer. Ces scientifiques sont en train de transformer les cafards en robots. Chaque cafard porte un petit sac contenant un microprocesseur. Les chercheurs peuvent ensuite envoyer des signaux de la télécommande au sac. Les signaux contrôlent les mouvements des cafards.
Pourquoi quelqu'un voudrait-il contrôler un cafard ? ""Les insectes peuvent faire beaucoup de choses que les humains ne peuvent pas faire"", déclare Isao Shimoyama, responsable de la recherche robotique à l'Université de Tokyo. Dans quelques années, dit-il, ces insectes robotiques porteront de très petites caméras. Ils pourront se déplacer dans les décombres d'un tremblement de terre pour rechercher des personnes ou se déplacer sous les portes pour obtenir des informations sur quelqu'un.
Cela peut sembler étrange, mais le gouvernement japonais pense que la recherche est très importante. Le gouvernement accorde aux scientifiques 5 millions de dollars pour cette recherche.
Tout d'abord, les chercheurs élèvent des centaines de cafards. Ils n'utilisent que le cafard américain car il est plus grand et plus fort que les autres cafards. Ensuite, ils choisissent les meilleurs cafards et leur retirent les ailes et les antennes. Ils placent de petits sacs à l'endroit où se trouvaient les antennes. Les sacs pèsent environ trois grammes, soit environ deux fois le poids des cafards eux-mêmes. ""Les cafards sont très forts"", explique Ralph Holzer, chercheur à l'Université de Tokyo. ""Ils peuvent soulever 20 fois leur propre poids.""
À l'aide d'une télécommande, les scientifiques envoient des signaux aux sacs. Lorsqu'un cafard reçoit le signal, il se déplace. Le problème est que les cafards ne se déplacent pas toujours dans la bonne direction.

"Le sport joue un rôle important dans la vie britannique. Le sport le plus populaire est le football. Le cricket est également populaire en Angleterre, mais est moins important dans les autres nations constitutives. Le rugby à XV et le rugby à XIII sont les autres grands sports d'équipe. Le tennis est le sport le plus important pendant les deux semaines du tournoi de Wimbledon. 

**Football**

Le football mondial moderne s'est développé à partir des jeux de football britanniques traditionnels au XIXe siècle. Le football de club est organisé séparément dans chacune des nations constitutives. Le football anglais a un système de ligues qui regroupe des milliers de clubs. L'Écosse a une structure de football de club similaire mais plus petite. Le niveau supérieur de la ligue au Pays de Galles est la Ligue du Pays de Galles. En Irlande du Nord, la ligue principale est la Ligue de football irlandaise.

Chaque saison, les clubs les plus performants de chacune des nations constitutives se qualifient pour (......) les deux compétitions de clubs à l'échelle européenne organisées par l'UEFA, la Ligue des champions de l'UEFA et la Coupe de l'UEFA.

**Cricket**

Le cricket a été inventé en Angleterre. Il est considéré comme le sport national d'été de l'Angleterre et est probablement le deuxième sport le plus couvert.

Il existe dix-huit clubs de pays professionnels, dont dix-sept en Angleterre et un au Pays de Galles. Chaque été, les clubs de pays s'affrontent dans le Championnat de pays de première classe, qui comprend deux ligues de neuf équipes et dans lequel les matches se jouent sur quatre jours.

**Rugby**

Comme le football, le rugby à XV et le rugby à XIII se sont tous deux développés à partir des jeux de football britanniques traditionnels au XIXe siècle. Pendant une grande partie du XXe siècle, il y a eu une grande rivalité entre le rugby à XIII, qui était un jeu principalement de classe ouvrière basé dans les zones industrielles du nord de l'Angleterre, et le rugby à XV, qui est un jeu principalement de classe moyenne en Angleterre et qui est également populaire dans les autres nations constitutives.

**Tennis**

Le tennis est un autre sport originaire du Royaume-Uni et l'organisme dirigeant de ce sport est la LTA. Cependant, aucun Britannique n'a remporté Wimbledon depuis 1936 et aucune Britannique depuis 1977. Les seuls joueurs britanniques des deux sexes à avoir atteint le top 50 mondial ces dernières années sont Greg Rusedski, qui a appris son tennis au Canada, et Tim Henman et Andrew Murray, qui n'ont pas non plus passé par le système de la LTA.

"BEIJING - Les plus hauts responsables sanitaires du pays affirment que la décision d'une organisation caritative internationale de ne pas verser des millions de dollars à des organisations chinoises luttant contre le sida et d'autres maladies ne conduira pas à la fin de ces organisations.
Le Fonds mondial de lutte contre le sida, la tuberculose et le paludisme a annoncé lundi qu'il retirait 95 millions de dollars des 270 millions de dollars de subventions qu'il avait prévu de verser à la Chine. Cette décision est le résultat de mois de discussions entre l'organisation caritative et les responsables chinois.
Sur le continent, un grand nombre de programmes destinés à prévenir la propagation du VIH/sida ont reçu des fonds du Fonds mondial. De nombreux observateurs craignent désormais que la réduction annoncée ne sape le travail de ces organisations.
Chen Zhu, ministre de la Santé, a déclaré que les responsables avaient trouvé un moyen de limiter les dommages. ""Au cours des cinq prochaines années, le gouvernement chinois augmentera constamment son soutien financier aux organisations sociales, en particulier celles qui s'efforcent de contrôler et de prévenir le VIH/sida."" a déclaré Chen lors de son discours à la 6e conférence d'échange d'expériences sur le programme de coopération internationale sur le VIH/sida en Chine, lundi.
Une récente enquête auprès de plus de 200 organisations participant à la lutte contre le VIH/sida sur le continent a révélé que près de 80 % d'entre elles avaient reçu des subventions du Fonds mondial. Environ 83 % d'entre elles ont déclaré qu'il leur serait difficile de continuer à fonctionner sans soutien financier de l'étranger. Les statistiques officielles montrent que le Fonds mondial a versé à la Chine 548 millions de dollars de subventions depuis 2003.
Xia Jing, responsable d'une organisation communautaire basée à Beijing et dédiée à la lutte contre le sida, a déclaré : ""Nous étions comme des enfants nourris au lait étranger. Lorsque l'argent étranger a commencé à être retiré de Chine, nous avons été confrontés à de graves difficultés financières."" Han Mengjie, directeur exécutif des programmes du Fonds mondial en Chine, a déclaré que le gouvernement chinois avait pleinement reconnu le rôle important que jouent les organisations sociales dans la lutte contre les maladies. ""Le travail effectué et les efforts déployés par ces organisations doivent être soutenus pendant longtemps pour compléter le travail d'intervention du gouvernement"", a-t-il déclaré. ""Nous devons faire face à la vérité selon laquelle l'argent international pour la lutte contre le sida quittera progressivement la Chine et nous préparer à y faire face.""

"Comme toute cérémonie de récompenses de son âge, les Oscars, qui en sont à leur 85e année, tentent désespérément de changer.

Alors, comment cela s'est-il passé cette année ? Lorsque l'animateur Seth MacFarlane a fait remarquer dans son discours d'ouverture que c'était la première fois que les Oscars avaient un thème, j'ai pensé : ""eh bien, c'est un bon début.""

Mais lorsqu'il a révélé que le thème était un hommage aux comédies musicales, j'ai eu moins de certitude. Après tout, ce n'est pas la première fois que les comédies musicales sont mises en avant aux Oscars.

En 2007, la distribution de Dreamgirls a donné une performance spéciale dirigée par le réalisateur de cinéma et vétéran de la comédie musicale Bill Condon. Puis il y a eu le spectacle mémorable de 2009 animé par Hugh Jackman, qui crie ""comédies musicales"". Avec Beyoncé Knowles et Anne Hathaway, il a interprété plusieurs chansons à succès de comédies musicales. Et en 2010, comment Neil Patrick Harris a-t-il présenté les animateurs ? En interprétant un numéro musical.

Alors je suppose que les Oscars auraient pu faire mieux cette année. Mais je dois admettre qu'il y a eu plus de performances musicales dans le spectacle de trois heures et demie que jamais auparavant. Cela suggère que les Oscars ont abandonné une partie de leur arrogance et veulent offrir aux téléspectateurs plus de divertissement.

C'est une initiative opportune, car les Golden Globes, également connus sous le nom de ""la grande fête"", sont devenus une menace pour les Oscars, leur volant des téléspectateurs et même leur réputation. Il suffit de regarder la liste des gagnants aux Oscars cette année.

On ne peut pas reprocher à l'Académie de vouloir faire enrager les Golden Globes. Alors qu'ils ont engagé Tina Fey et Amy Poehler pour animer le spectacle - certainement plus attrayantes pour le public que MacFarlane - et que Bill Clinton a été invité comme présentateur, qui les téléspectateurs ont-ils eu aux Oscars ? La Première Dame des États-Unis, Michelle Obama.

Bravo, Oscar ! On sait que vous luttez pour paraître frais et jeune, mais ne perdez pas la fierté et la dignité qui ont fait de vous l'une des plus grandes distinctions de l'industrie cinématographique. Ne laissez jamais cela changer.

"Pour toute personne devant prendre la parole en public, que ce soit devant des groupes professionnels ou de loisirs, l'humour est un outil utile, voire nécessaire, pour faire passer son message. Pourquoi l'humour fonctionne-t-il autant ? Il y a plusieurs raisons.

Les gens apprécieront ce que vous avez à dire si cela est présenté avec humour. Mais, plus important encore, si vous vous trouvez dans une situation où des idées importantes et peut-être controversées doivent être présentées à des esprits peu ouverts, l'humour permet de les présenter de manière non menaçante. Abraham Lincoln était célèbre pour sa capacité à raconter des histoires humoristiques pour faire passer un point. L'humour utilisé avec soin tout au long d'une présentation maintiendra également l'intérêt de l'auditeur élevé. En un mot, les personnes apprenant à utiliser l'humour dans leurs discours peuvent renforcer les arguments, soutenir des présentations intéressantes et, surtout, divertir leur public de manière positive et confortable.

Bien que la culture populaire puisse bien proposer de nombreux types d'humour, certains d'entre eux n'ont pas leur place dans les présentations conçues pour éduquer et encourager le public. Si vous souhaitez devenir un humoriste professionnel dont le but est 100% divertissement, vous pourrez alors utiliser certains des supports de référence comme L'Art d'utiliser l'humour en public. Ils peuvent vous aider à développer vos compétences et vos sources d'humour. À cet _ , votre participation à cette étude de l'humour deviendra nécessaire. Espérons que vous en viendrez à apprécier la difficulté particulière de divertir le public avec un humour bon et propre.

"Quelque chose rugit comme le tonnerre. La terre trembla légèrement et nous entendîmes le rat-a-tat-tat des coups de feu. ""Père !"" cria Hassan. Nous nous sommes levés d'un bond et avons couru hors du salon.
""Père ! Qu'est-ce que ce bruit ?"" hurla Hassan, ses mains tendues vers Ali. Ali nous enveloppa de ses bras. Une lumière blanche brilla et éclaira le ciel d'argent. Elle reflamba et fut suivie par des sons rapides et vifs de coups de feu. ""Ils chassent les canards"", dit Ali d'une voix rauque. ""Ils chassent les canards la nuit, tu sais."" N'aie pas peur.
Une sirène s'est mise en marche au loin. Quelque part, du verre s'est brisé et quelqu'un a crié. J'ai entendu des gens dans la rue, arrachés au sommeil et probablement encore en pyjama, avec les cheveux ébouriffés et des yeux gonflés. Hassan pleurait. Ali l'a serré contre lui, l'a serré avec tendresse.
Nous sommes restés blottis ainsi jusqu'aux premières heures du matin. Les tirs et les explosions avaient duré moins d'une heure, mais ils nous avaient terriblement effrayés, car aucun d'entre nous n'avait jamais entendu de coups de feu dans la rue. C'était des sons étrangers pour nous à l'époque. La génération d'enfants afghans dont les oreilles ne connaîtraient que le son des bombes et des coups de feu n'était pas encore née. Blottis ensemble dans la salle à manger et attendant que le soleil se lève, aucun d'entre nous ne se doutait qu'un mode de vie avait pris fin. La fin est arrivée lorsque les chars russes ont roulé dans les mêmes rues où Hassan et moi jouions, apportant la mort de l'Afghanistan que je connaissais et marquant le début d'une ère de bains de sang toujours en cours.
Juste avant le lever du soleil, la voiture de Baba a déboulé dans l'allée. Sa porte s'est claquée et ses pas précipités ont battu les marches. Puis il est apparu dans l'embrasure de la porte et j'ai vu quelque chose sur son visage. Quelque chose que je n'ai pas reconnu tout de suite parce que je ne l'avais jamais vu auparavant : la peur. ""Amir ! Hassan !"" cria-t-il en courant vers nous, ouvrant grand ses bras. ""Ils ont bloqué toutes les routes et le téléphone ne marchait pas. J'étais si inquiet !""

Trop de gens remettent à plus tard quelque chose qui leur procure de la joie simplement parce qu'ils n'y ont pas pensé, ou parce qu'ils ne sont pas disposés à essayer quelque chose de nouveau.

Ma sœur est décédée il y a quelques années. Nous n'avons jamais déjeuné ensemble. Je ne me souviens pas combien de fois elle m'a refusé quand je l'ai appelée pour aller déjeuner.

D'un coup d'œil rapide par-dessus son épaule pour s'assurer que Len n'était pas revenu, il a appuyé sur tous les boutons à la fois. Santi a vu un éclair lumineux et il a lâché la télécommande.

"L'Internet relie des millions d'ordinateurs dans le monde entier et il est utilisé par des gens du monde entier. Il a été inventé dans les années 1960 aux États-Unis. Le gouvernement américain avait besoin d'un réseau d'ordinateurs pour son armée. Puis, dans les années 1970, les scientifiques et les hommes d'affaires ont également souhaité utiliser Internet pour envoyer et recevoir des messages. Pendant quelques années, ils n'ont pas été autorisés à utiliser le réseau américain, et lorsqu'ils ont été autorisés, les messages étaient en texte très simple sans photos.

Le World Wide Web a été inventé par un scientifique britannique nommé Tim Berners-Lee en 1989. Il voulait envoyer des documents à d'autres scientifiques. Il a donc développé le World Wide Web. Cela lui a permis d'envoyer et de recevoir des documents scientifiques avec du texte, des dessins et des photos. Dans les années 1990, de plus en plus de personnes ont commencé à utiliser Internet et le World Wide Web.

Alors, quelle est la différence entre Internet et le World Wide Web ? Internet est le matériel. Il nous permet de communiquer avec d'autres personnes. Le World Wide Web est le logiciel. Il nous permet de créer, de voir et de lire des documents multimédias.

Le Web est constitué de millions de documents appelés pages Web. Ces pages sont hébergées sur des ordinateurs du monde entier. De nombreuses personnes ont un site Web préféré avec un certain nombre de pages Web sur le même sujet.

Le courrier électronique est un moyen d'utiliser votre ordinateur pour envoyer et recevoir des messages. C'est moins cher et plus rapide d'utiliser le courrier électronique que d'envoyer du courrier normal. Les nouveaux utilisateurs appellent le courrier normal ""snail mail"" car il est si lent.

Il a fallu 50 ans pour que 100 millions de personnes écoutent la radio. Il a fallu 15 ans pour que 100 millions de personnes regardent la télévision. En 2000, il n'avait fallu qu'environ trois ans pour que 100 millions de personnes utilisent Internet. Que se passera-t-il ensuite sur Internet ?

"Le plus grand avion au monde a fait ses débuts publics la semaine dernière dans la plus grande usine d'Europe, une chaîne de montage construite à cet effet à Toulouse, dans le sud de la France. L'Airbus A380 offrira 50 % de surface au sol en plus que le Boeing 747 Jumbo de son rival américain, avec de la place pour des boutiques hors taxes, des restaurants et même un sauna. Cette nouvelle arrivée devrait changer la face du voyage aérien.

L'A380 entrera en service début 2006 avec Singapore Airlines.

Airbus affirme que l'A380 consommera moins de carburant, fera moins de bruit, générera moins de pollution et coûtera 17 % de moins par siège que le 747. Il réduira également les problèmes de circulation dans le ciel.

L'avion, qui coûte entre 140 millions de livres sterling (250 millions de dollars) et 157 millions de livres sterling (280 millions de dollars) chacun, contre 84 millions de livres sterling (150 millions de dollars) pour le nouveau jet Dreamliner de Boeing, est construit dans 16 usines en Allemagne, en France, en Espagne et au Royaume-Uni.

Mais les militants ont mis en garde contre plus de bruit et de pollution de la part du Superjumbo, tandis que Boeing estime que les avions de grande taille ne seront pas très demandés au cours de la prochaine décennie.

En conséquence, il mise sur le 7E7 Dreamliner, beaucoup plus petit. Mais Airbus fonde ses espoirs sur la théorie ""le grand est beau"", misant sur la taille comme facteur clé dans la bataille américano-européenne pour le ciel.

Airbus a déclaré être en pourparlers avec une demi-douzaine de compagnies aériennes mondiales au sujet de l'achat de l'A380. China Eastern Airlines, déjà cliente d'Airbus, serait ciblée, tandis que les dirigeants ont clairement fait savoir qu'ils souhaitaient se battre pour le marché japonais, qui était traditionnellement contrôlé par Boeing.

Au cours des 20 prochaines années, Airbus espère vendre 750 de ces nouveaux avions sur un marché d'une valeur de 185 milliards de livres sterling (330 milliards de dollars). La société a déjà 129 commandes fermes pour l'A380, avec 52 options.

"Le bonheur est **contagieux**, ont rapporté des chercheurs jeudi. Plus vous connaissez de personnes heureuses, plus vous avez de chances d'être heureux vous-même. Et se connecter à des personnes heureuses améliore le bonheur d'une personne. Des chercheurs ont analysé une collection de données provenant de feuilles de suivi datant de 1971, suivant les naissances, les mariages, les décès et les divorces. Les bénévoles ont également répertorié les informations de leurs amis les plus proches, de leurs collègues et de leurs voisins.
Ils ont évalué le **bonheur** avec un test simple à quatre questions. ""On demande aux gens à quelle fréquence au cours de la semaine dernière, premièrement, j'ai apprécié la vie, deuxièmement, j'étais heureux, troisièmement, je me sentais optimiste quant à l'avenir, et quatrièmement, je sentais que j'étais aussi bien que les autres"", a déclaré Fowler. Les 60 % des personnes qui ont obtenu un score élevé aux quatre questions ont été considérées comme heureuses, tandis que les autres ont été considérées comme malheureuses.
Les personnes ayant le plus de **liens sociaux** - amis, conjoints, voisins - étaient également les plus heureuses, selon les données. ""Chaque personne heureuse supplémentaire vous rend plus heureux"", a déclaré Christakis.
Et le bonheur est plus **contagieux** que le malheur, ont-ils découvert. Si un contact social est heureux, cela augmente de 15 % la possibilité que vous soyez heureux. Un ami d'un ami, ou l'ami d'un conjoint ou d'un frère ou d'une sœur, s'il est heureux, augmente vos chances de 10 %. Un ami heureux de troisième degré - l'ami d'un ami d'un ami - augmente les chances d'une personne d'être heureuse de 6 %. Mais chaque ami malheureux supplémentaire augmente la possibilité que vous soyez malheureux de seulement 7 %.
Cette découverte est **intéressante et utile**. Parmi ses autres avantages, le bonheur s'est avéré avoir un effet important sur la réduction du taux de mortalité, la réduction de la douleur et l'amélioration de la fonction cardiaque. Ainsi, une meilleure compréhension de la façon dont le bonheur se propage peut nous aider à apprendre à promouvoir une société plus saine. D'autres données suggèrent qu'avoir 5 000 $ supplémentaires augmente les chances d'une personne de devenir plus heureuse d'environ 2 %. Un ami heureux vaut environ 40 000 $.

"Ayant garé ma voiture près du lavage auto à côté du supermarché, j'en suis sorti pour attendre que ma femme finisse son travail. S'approchant de moi depuis l'autre bout du parking, se trouvait ce que la société qualifierait de clochard. À son allure, il n'avait ni voiture, ni maison, ni vêtements propres, ni argent. Il y a des moments où l'on se sent généreux, mais il y a aussi des moments où l'on ne veut tout simplement pas être dérangé. C'était l'un de ces moments où je ne voulais pas être dérangé. 
""J'espère qu'il ne me demandera pas d'argent,"" pensais-je. Il ne le fit pas. Il s'assit sur le banc de l'arrêt de bus, mais il n'avait pas l'air d'avoir assez d'argent pour prendre le bus. Après quelques minutes, il parla : ""C'est une très belle voiture"". Il était en haillons, mais il avait une certaine dignité autour de lui. J'ai répondu ""merci"" sans le regarder. 
Il resta assis là, silencieux pendant un moment. La mendicité attendue pour de l'argent ne vint jamais. Alors que le silence entre nous s'épaississait, quelque chose à l'intérieur de moi a dit : ""Demande-lui s'il a besoin d'aide."" J'étais sûr qu'il dirait ""oui"". Alors j'ai demandé : ""Avez-vous besoin d'aide ?"" Il a répondu en trois mots simples que je n'oublierai jamais. Ces trois mots m'ont secoué. ""Ne l'avons-nous pas tous ?"" a-t-il dit. 
Je me sentais bien, important, au-dessus d'un clochard dans la rue, jusqu'à ce que ces trois mots me frappent. Ne l'avons-nous pas tous ? J'avais besoin d'aide.

J'ai fouillé dans mon portefeuille et je lui ai donné non seulement assez pour le prix du bus, mais aussi assez pour obtenir un repas chaud et un abri pour la journée.

"Annette Kellerman est née en Australie en 1887. Elle a contracté la polio et avait du mal à marcher. Elle devait porter des supports métalliques à ses jambes pour pouvoir se tenir debout. Pour renforcer ses jambes, sa mère l'emmenait chaque semaine à des cours de natation. La natation a rendu ses jambes si fortes que lorsqu'elle a eu 15 ans, elle a pu jeter ses supports.

"Madame Denner,

Au cours des cinq derniers mois, votre mari a causé pas mal de remous dans notre magasin. Nos plaintes concernant Monsieur Denner sont listées ci-dessous :

2 juillet : Il a mis tous les réveils du rayon électroménager à sonner à intervalles de cinq minutes.
7 juillet : Il a fait un chemin de jus de tomate sur le sol menant aux toilettes pour femmes.
4 août : Il a pris un sac de _ du rayon confiseries et l'a distribué aux enfants qui passaient pour qu'ils le mangent.
14 septembre : Il a déplacé un panneau ""ATTENTION - SOL MOUILLE"" sur une zone recouverte de moquette.
15 septembre : Il a installé une tente dans le rayon camping et a dit aux autres clients qu'il les inviterait si ils apportaient des oreillers et des couvertures du rayon literie.
23 septembre : Lorsqu'un employé lui a demandé s'il pouvait l'aider, il s'est mis à pleurer et a crié : ""Pourquoi vous ne me laissez pas tranquille ?""
4 octobre : Il a regardé directement la caméra de sécurité et l'a utilisée comme miroir pendant qu'il se nettoyait le nez.
10 novembre : Alors qu'il manipulait des armes à feu dans le rayon chasse, il a demandé à l'employé où se trouvaient les antidépresseurs.
3 décembre : Il a couru dans le magasin en fredonnant à voix haute le thème de ""Mission Impossible"".
6 décembre : Dans le rayon automobile, il s'est entraîné à faire le ""look Madonna"" en utilisant des entonnoirs de différentes tailles.
18 décembre : Il s'est caché dans un portant à vêtements et, lorsque des gens ont regardé, il a crié : ""Choisissez-moi ! Choisissez-moi !""
21 décembre : Lorsqu'une annonce est passée par haut-parleur, il a pris une position fatale et a crié : ""Oh non ! Ce sont encore ces voix !""
23 décembre : Il est entré dans une cabine d'essayage, a fermé la porte, a attendu un moment, puis a crié très fort : ""Hé ! Il n'y a pas de papier toilette ici !""

Nos caméras de surveillance ont enregistré tout cela. Nos rappels et avertissements n'ont jamais eu aucun effet, et nous sommes donc contraints de lui interdire l'accès au magasin.

Cordialement,

"Une très vieille dame a gagné un million de dollars à la loterie. Son fils et sa femme ont entendu la nouvelle à la radio. ""Comment allons-nous le dire à ta mère ?"" demanda la femme. ""Le choc pourrait la tuer !""
""C'est vrai,"" dit le fils. ""Peut-être devrions-nous en parler à son médecin. Il saura comment lui annoncer la nouvelle en douceur.""

Il réfléchit au problème pendant plusieurs jours, puis décida ce qu'il dirait. Il rendit visite à la vieille dame et s'assit à ses côtés. Il prit sa main dans la sienne. ""Jouons à un jeu, ma chère"", dit-il. ""Un jeu de 'Faisons comme si' "".

"De nos jours, les gens se plaignent constamment du stress de leur vie quotidienne. Avec la large disponibilité des médicaments sur le marché aujourd'hui, il est toujours conseillé de consommer le meilleur type de médicament pour notre corps, c'est-à-dire les médicaments naturels.

L'une des ressources naturelles pour un médicament relaxant est l'extrait de racine de valériane. Scientifiquement connue sous le nom de Valeriana Officinalis, cette plante est une plante à fleurs aux têtes de fleurs roses et blanches qui fleurissent principalement pendant les mois d'été. Originaire d'Europe et de petites parties de l'Asie, la plante est devenue populaire dans le monde entier en raison de son parfum sucré et de ses avantages uniques pour la santé.

Des recherches antérieures suggèrent que la racine de valériane possède des caractéristiques cicatrisantes qui se concentrent sur le neurotransmetteur du cerveau, ce qui permet aux cellules cérébrales de bien fonctionner. D'autres recherches sur cette herbe suggèrent qu'elle peut aider une personne à rester libre de l'anxiété. Bien qu'il existe différents types de produits à base de racine de valériane sur le marché aujourd'hui, des études médicales modernes ont conclu que des recherches supplémentaires doivent être prises en compte avant de reconnaître les prétendus bienfaits des extraits de racine de valériane.

Un exemple de ces prétendus bienfaits est le traitement du trouble anxieux appelé ""trouble d'anxiété sociale"" ou TAS. Le bénéfice a _ preuves pour étayer sa prétention d'être un soulagement alternatif de l'anxiété. Cependant, de nombreux patients ont déclaré avoir ressenti des améliorations de leur état nerveux, de leur stress et de leurs capacités mentales globales.

L'extrait de racine de valériane peut être obtenu sous forme de thé, de comprimés ou d'extrait liquide. Il est recommandé de consulter votre médecin concernant cette plante médicinale pour savoir si elle peut réellement être bénéfique pour votre santé.

"Voici quelques introductions à quatre femmes puissantes dans le monde.

Park Geun-hye, Présidente de la Corée du Sud
Mercredi, les Sud-Coréens ont choisi la fille du dirigeant sud-coréen de la guerre froide, Park Chung-hee, comme prochaine présidente du pays. Park, la dirigeante de 60 ans du parti conservateur Saenuri, a battu le candidat libéral de 59 ans, Moon Jae-in, d'environ 3,5 %. Elle sera la première femme présidente de la Corée du Sud.

Angela Merkel, Chancelière d'Allemagne
Angela Merkel est la Chancelière d'Allemagne et la dirigeante du parti de l'Union chrétienne-démocrate (CDU). Merkel est la première femme à être devenue Chancelière d'Allemagne. Angela Merkel a été décrite comme ""la dirigeante de facto de l'Union européenne"" et sa réponse prudente à la crise de l'euro est soutenue par la plupart des Allemands et de son parti.

Hillary Clinton, Secrétaire d'État américaine
Hillary Clinton est la 67e Secrétaire d'État des États-Unis, servant dans l'administration du président Barack Obama. Elle a mis en place des changements institutionnels visant à maximiser l'efficacité du département et à donner aux femmes du monde entier du pouvoir et du statut, et a établi des records pour la secrétaire la plus voyageuse en fonction. On pense qu'Hillary Clinton se prépare à démissionner de son poste de Secrétaire d'État, ce qui a provoqué de nombreuses rumeurs sur une possible candidature à la Maison-Blanche en 2016.

Aung San Suu Kyi, Présidente de la Ligue nationale pour la démocratie birmane
Aung San Suu Kyi est une femme politique birmane de l'opposition. En tant que dirigeante pro-démocratie, elle est restée en résidence surveillée en Birmanie pendant près de 15 ans à partir du 20 juillet 1989 à la suite de son combat pour la démocratie jusqu'à ce qu'elle obtienne sa liberté le 13 novembre 2010. Comme le dirigeant sud-africain Nelson Mandela, Aung San Suu Kyi est devenue un symbole international de résistance pacifique face à l'oppression.

Le prix Nobel de la paix 1991 a été décerné à Aung San Suu Kyi ""pour sa lutte non violente pour la démocratie et les droits de l'homme"". Elle a finalement prononcé son discours de réception du prix Nobel le 16 juin 2012 à l'hôtel de ville d'Oslo, en Norvège.

"Pour les Américains, une piqûre de moustique est une gêne qui démange. Mais pour beaucoup d'Africains, une minuscule morsure peut être mortelle. Un million de personnes meurent chaque année du paludisme, une maladie transmise par des moustiques infectés. La plupart de ces personnes vivent en Afrique et ont moins de 5 ans.

Le paludisme peut être prévenu et traité. Cependant, de nombreux pays africains n'ont pas les moyens de le combattre. Nothing But Nets (NBN) espère changer cela. La Fondation des Nations Unies a créé la campagne en 2006. L'objectif est de prévenir le paludisme en couvrant les zones de sommeil avec des moustiquaires. Suspendre des moustiquaires traitées aux insecticides est la façon la plus simple d'empêcher les moustiques de piquer la nuit. Les produits chimiques durent quatre à cinq ans. Pour 10 $, tout le monde peut envoyer une moustiquaire en Afrique et contribuer à sauver une vie.

Jusqu'à présent, NBN a collecté 19 millions de dollars et livré 700 000 moustiquaires dans sept pays. Les familles apprennent à utiliser les moustiquaires. Les enfants reçoivent également des vaccins et des vitamines. ""Les femmes font la queue pendant des kilomètres pour obtenir des médicaments pour leurs enfants"", explique Elizabeth McKee Gore, directrice de NBN. ""Elles comprennent l'importance.""

C'est aussi le cas des enfants dans ce pays. ""Ils sont tellement excités à l'idée de trouver des moyens de collecter des fonds"", explique Ruth Riley, porte-parole de NBN et star du basket-ball.

La plus grande collecte de fonds de NBN est Katherine Commale, 7 ans. Elle diffuse des informations sur les moustiquaires depuis deux ans. Pour montrer comment elles fonctionnent, elle et son frère ont réalisé une vidéo. ""Nous enseignons que les moustiquaires peuvent sauver des vies"", a-t-elle déclaré.

Katherine a collecté 42 000 $ pour NBN. ""Elle veut simplement que ceux qui ont besoin d'une moustiquaire en aient une"", explique sa mère, Lynda. ""C'est assez simple pour elle."" Pour savoir comment vous pouvez aider, visitez nothingbutnets.net.

"Les sentiments doux-amers du baccalauréat font partie de moi aujourd'hui tout autant qu'ils l'étaient il y a vingt et un ans.

Alors que le jour de la remise des diplômes approchait, l'excitation augmentait. Sortir du lycée signifiait que j'avais enfin grandi. Bientôt, je serais indépendant, prenant mes propres décisions, faisant ce qui m'intéressait sans que personne ne me regarde par-dessus l'épaule.

Il n'y a jamais eu de doute dans mon esprit que j'irais à l'université. Mais quelle université j'allais fréquenter semblait être une liste interminable d'inconnues : À quoi ressemblerait l'université ? Est-ce que je me ferais facilement des amis ? Est-ce que j'aurais tellement le mal du pays que je ne pourrais pas le supporter ? Et si l'université que j'avais choisie s'avérait être une terrible erreur ?

Puis la panique s'est installée. Mes sentiments ont fait un virage à 180 degrés. Je ne voulais vraiment pas quitter le lycée du tout. C'était agréable d'être respecté en tant que senior par les élèves de classe inférieure pendant la dernière année ; je n'aimais pas l'idée d'être à nouveau en bas de l'échelle.

Malgré des mois d'attente, rien n'aurait pu me préparer à l'impact du jour même. Alors que la mélodie familière de ""Pomp and Circumstance"" résonnait en arrière-plan, les larmes ont monté aux yeux sans pouvoir être contenues, et j'ai été envahie par un torrent de tristesse. Je me suis levé de mon siège en entendant mon nom être appelé et j'ai traversé la scène lentement pour recevoir mon diplôme. En tendant la main, je savais que je ne tentais pas seulement de prendre un morceau de papier, mais une nouvelle vie. Aussi excitante que puisse paraître l'avenir d'une nouvelle vie, il n'était pas facile de dire au revoir à l'ancienne - les visages familiers, la routine familière. J'aurais même manqué ce cours de chimie que je n'appréciais pas particulièrement.

Ce septembre, j'ai eu la chance de fréquenter une université formidable. Je n'avais pas à m'inquiéter de l'aimer. Mes années là-bas se sont avérées être parmi les meilleures de ma vie. Et pour ce qui est des amis, certaines des amitiés que j'ai nouées là-bas, je les chéris encore aujourd'hui.

"Selon une étude récente, le meilleur moyen de guérir la tristesse n'est pas le shopping. La méthode dite du shopping est devenue une pratique courante de nos jours, mais cela peut mettre votre portefeuille sous une forte pression. Donc, si vous êtes triste et que vous avez envie de faire du shopping, ne le faites pas !

Selon l'étude récente, la tristesse conduit à une pensée égocentrique. En d'autres termes, les personnes tristes sont prêtes à dépenser plus d'argent pour la même chose que les personnes calmes.

""C'est le résultat de la tristesse et de l'égocentrisme, et il s'avère que la tristesse conduit à une augmentation de l'égocentrisme"", a déclaré Cynthia Cruder. ""Ce que nous pensons, c'est que les personnes tristes et égocentriques se sentent assez mal dans leur peau, et une façon de gérer cela est d'acheter des biens matériels.""

Dans une situation idéale, lorsque vous savez que vous êtes triste, vous devriez éviter de prendre des décisions et de dépenser de l'argent. Cela semble simple ? Malheureusement, ce n'est pas le cas. La plupart des gens ne savent même pas qu'ils sont tristes, montre l'étude, et ils ne sont pas conscients que leurs sentiments influencent leurs décisions.

Que faire ? L'étude a montré que ceux qui ont regardé une tragédie étaient plus susceptibles de dépenser trois fois plus d'argent pour une simple bouteille d'eau que ceux qui ont regardé une comédie. La solution : eh bien, pour commencer, n'allez pas faire du shopping ! Si vous ne pouvez pas vous en empêcher, il est probablement préférable de consulter un médecin.

"Un jour, un homme physiquement déformé est arrivé dans notre université, et sur son dos, il y avait une pancarte disant : ""Réparation de chaussures gratuite pour les étudiants"". Réparer des chaussures gratuitement ? La plupart d'entre nous n'y croyaient pas, et certains pensaient même que c'était juste un stratagème pour piéger les étudiants qui devraient ensuite payer pour leurs chaussures une fois réparées. Mais l'homme a simplement souri et dit : ""Gardez votre argent pour acheter des livres."" Ces mots m'ont vraiment surpris et j'ai discuté avec lui. ""Vous devez gagner votre vie. Pourquoi réparez-vous des chaussures gratuitement pour nous ?"" Il a répondu, tout en continuant son travail : ""Je suis analphabète, mais je sais à quel point la connaissance est importante pour tout le monde. Je voudrais donc servir les étudiants comme vous. J'espère que vous réussirez dans vos études. À mon avis, l'argent n'est pas tout dans la vie."" 

Après cette conversation, j'ai senti qu'il était formidable comparé à moi.

"Pour la plupart des Sud-Africains, Nelson Mandela est le père de leur nation - beaucoup l'appelaient même ""Tata"", un mot local pour père. On oubliait parfois qu'il était aussi un véritable père de six enfants, grand-père de dix-huit, arrière-grand-père de huit et mari de trois femmes.
Il s'est taillé une place dans l'histoire, tout comme un autre père de nation, Mahatma Gandhi. Mais il existait une différence fondamentale entre ces hommes bien-aimés. Si Gandhi était considéré comme un homme de famille déprimé, Mandela était un homme de famille fort et aimant. Malgré tout, Mandela et sa famille ont payé un lourd tribut pour son dévouement à la liberté de son pays.
Mandela lui-même a offert un aperçu de sa guerre personnelle. ""Être le père d'une nation est un grand honneur, mais être le père d'une famille est une joie plus grande. _ "" a-t-il déclaré en avril 1992, annonçant sa séparation avec Winnie.
En 1944, Nelson Mandela a épousé Evelyn. ""Je ne pouvais pas abandonner ma vie dans la lutte"", a expliqué Mandela dans son autobiographie, Long Walk to Freedom, ""et elle (Evelyn) ne pouvait pas vivre avec mon dévouement à quelque chose d'autre qu'elle et sa famille... Je n'ai jamais perdu mon admiration pour elle, mais au final, nous n'avons pas pu faire fonctionner notre mariage."" Ils ont divorcé en 1958.
Lors du décès d'Evelyn en 2004, Mandela s'est tenu à son chevet avec sa troisième épouse, Graca. Winnie a également assisté aux funérailles.
Mandela a épousé Winnie en 1958. Mais Winnie a supporté les difficultés de la vie de Mandela, endurant les 27 années d'emprisonnement de son mari. De prison, Mandela a écrit certaines des plus belles lettres d'amour à Winnie. ""Je la dépoussière (votre photo) soigneusement chaque matin - je touche même votre nez avec le mien pour retrouver le courant électrique qui traversait autrefois mon sang chaque fois que je le faisais.""
Pour de nombreux Sud-Africains, c'est la fin d'une histoire d'amour de conte de fées lorsque leur séparation a été rendue publique en 1992. Des ""tensions"" étaient apparues et ils étaient convenus d'une séparation. La douleur dans ses paroles était claire : ""Peut-être étais-je aveugle à certaines choses à cause de la douleur que je ressentais de ne pas pouvoir jouer mon rôle de mari auprès de ma femme et de père auprès de mes enfants.""
""Des vies personnelles instables semblaient être le destin des combattants de la liberté"", a-t-il déclaré. ""Lorsque votre vie est la lutte, comme la mienne, il reste peu de place pour la famille. C'est toujours mon plus grand regret, et l'aspect le plus douloureux du choix que j'ai fait."" Le couple a divorcé en 1996.

"Nos enfants ont grandi avec des sandwichs au beurre de cacahuète et à la confiture. La bonne confiture les rend très heureux, et la confiture maison est le seul choix.
Je n'étais pas la faiseuse de confiture dans cette famille. C'était ma belle-mère. Elle ne proposait pas non plus une large gamme de saveurs. C'était soit du raisin, soit de la mûre. Et comme nous aimions les deux saveurs, nous choisissions généralement le pot qui se trouvait en avant du garde-manger.
Il était toujours là. La fabrication de confiture était une simple façon de vivre pour elle. Elle le faisait toujours, en suivant les mêmes habitudes - de la cueillette des fruits à la mise en place de la confiture finie sur les étagères faites maison.
Décembre dernier, ma belle-mère est décédée. Parmi les choses de la maison à partager, il y avait les conserves restantes. Chacun d'entre nous a choisi parmi les nombreux pots de jus de tomate, de haricots verts et de confiture.
L'autre jour, j'ai cherché de la confiture pour un sandwich rapide, et elle était là. Assis tout seul au fond de l'étagère, il y avait un petit pot de confiture de raisin. Écrit sur le couvercle avec un marqueur noir figurait ""GR"" pour raisin et l'année de fabrication de la confiture.
En prenant le pot, j'ai soudainement réalisé quelque chose que j'avais manqué de voir auparavant. C'était le dernier pot que nous aurions jamais de la part des mains patientes et aimantes de ma belle-mère. Nos enfants n'avaient jamais connu une journée sans la confiture de leur grand-mère. Cela semble être une si petite chose, mais c'était un grand trésor.
Tenant ce dernier pot dans ma main, mon cœur est retourné à ma première rencontre avec ma belle-mère. Je l'ai vue pleurer le jour de notre mariage, et plus tard, embrasser et aimer nos enfants. Je l'ai vue marcher dans les bois ou monter en wagon. Je l'ai vue entourée d'enfants aimants à ses funérailles.
J'ai remis la confiture sur l'étagère. Ce n'était plus qu'un pot de confiture. Je suppose que je croyais qu'aussi longtemps qu'elle serait là, ma belle-mère vivrait toujours.

"Dans les années 1880, les gens buvaient le tonique de John Pemberton pour soigner leurs maux de tête. Ce n'était pas une boisson très populaire, et il ne vendait qu'une douzaine de boissons par jour environ. C'est pourquoi Pemberton était prêt à vendre les droits de sa boisson médicinale. L'acheteur, Asa Griggs Candler, a payé seulement 2 300 dollars pour les droits de Coca-Cola. Aujourd'hui, Coca-Cola (ou Coke) vaut des milliards de dollars. Elle contrôle 50 % du marché mondial des boissons gazeuses.

Comment Coca-Cola est-elle devenue si populaire ? Une réponse est qu'Asa Candler était un homme d'affaires très intelligent. Il a été l'un des premiers à utiliser le marketing de masse. Comment a-t-il fait cela ? Tout d'abord, il a rendu son produit unique. Lorsqu'il a acheté les droits de Coca-Cola, elle était vendue dans des bouteilles ordinaires. Elle ressemblait à toutes les autres boissons du marché. Pour rendre Coca-Cola différente, Candler a modernisé les bouteilles. Il a également créé un logo accrocheur pour ses produits.

En plus de la bouteille et du logo uniques, Candler a consacré beaucoup de temps et d'argent à la publicité de son produit. Il a utilisé la publicité pour créer une image puissante de Coca-Cola dans l'esprit de ses clients. Il a offert des bouteilles de Coke gratuites. Il a apposé le nom de sa boisson sur des crayons, des plateaux, des éventails japonais, des allumettes et bien d'autres objets. Puis, il a offert ces objets gratuitement aux gens. Il a fait de la publicité pour Coca-Cola dans les journaux et a peint les mots « Buvez Coca-Cola » sur les côtés des bâtiments et des granges. En 1902, Coca-Cola était le produit le plus connu aux États-Unis.

Candler a également réussi à créer des publicités mémorables. Elles comportaient souvent des slogans accrocheurs tels que « La pause qui rafraîchit ». Il a également fait appel à des athlètes célèbres pour faire la publicité de son produit. Ils ont aidé les gens à penser à Coca-Cola comme une boisson délicieuse pour tout le monde.

Aujourd'hui, les entreprises du monde entier utilisent le marketing de masse, mais les fabricants de Coke ont été les premiers.

"Se débarrasser de la saleté est, de l'avis de la plupart des gens, une bonne chose. Cependant, les attitudes à l'égard de la saleté ne sont pas fixes.

Au début du XVIe siècle, les gens pensaient que la saleté sur la peau était un moyen de bloquer les maladies. L'opinion médicale voulait que laver la saleté à l'eau chaude puisse ouvrir la peau et laisser entrer les maux. Les bains publics étaient considérés comme particulièrement dangereux. En 1538, le roi de France fit fermer les bains publics dans son royaume. Le roi d'Angleterre fit de même en 1546. Ainsi commença une longue période où les riches et les pauvres d'Europe vivaient avec la saleté de manière amicale. Henri IV, roi de France, était célèbre pour sa saleté. Ayant appris qu'un noble avait pris un bain, le roi ordonna que, pour éviter les attaques de maladies, le noble ne devait pas sortir.

Bien que la croyance en la valeur de la saleté ait perduré longtemps, la saleté n'est plus considérée comme une bonne voisine depuis le XVIIIe siècle. Scientifiquement parlant, nettoyer la saleté est bon pour la santé. L'approvisionnement en eau potable et le lavage des mains sont des moyens pratiques de prévenir les maladies. Pourtant, il semble que les normes de propreté aient dépassé la science depuis la Seconde Guerre mondiale. Les publicités vendent constamment l'idée : les vêtements doivent être plus blancs que blancs, les tissus toujours plus doux, les surfaces doivent briller. La haine de la saleté est-elle cependant allée trop loin ?

Les attitudes envers la saleté diffèrent encore énormément de nos jours. De nombreux parents novices essaient nerveusement d'avertir leurs enfants de ne pas toucher la saleté, qui pourrait être responsable de la propagation de maladies. Au contraire, Mary Ruebush, une immunologiste américaine, encourage les enfants à jouer dans la saleté pour développer un système immunitaire fort. Et cette dernière position gagne du terrain.

"Lorsque deux Anglais se rencontrent, leurs premières paroles seront ""Comment allez-vous ?"" ou ""Comment allez-vous ?"". Après la réponse ""Comment allez-vous ?"" ou ""Bien, merci. Et vous ?"", ils parlent souvent du temps. La raison n'est pas simplement que leur météo est intéressante et changeante, mais que les Anglais n'aiment pas parler de questions personnelles avec des personnes qui ne sont pas des amis. Parler du temps peut être un moyen utile de commencer une conversation avec un étranger en public.

"Dior est né en Normandie en 1905, et les projets initiaux de sa famille pour lui comprenaient une carrière dans le service diplomatique, mais à l'âge de vingt-trois ans, avec l'argent de ses parents, il ouvrit une petite galerie d'art à Paris. En 1931, l'argent avait été épuisé. Les amis de Dior à la galerie d'art lui ont demandé de dessiner et il a fait ses premiers pas dans la conception et le dessin. Son premier emploi a été chez Lucien Lelong, de qui Dior a appris son métier.

En février 1947, Dior a lancé le New Look dans sa première grande collection parisienne. Il était soutenu par un célèbre producteur textile, Boussac, qui s'occupait des dollars, tandis que Dior s'occupait des modes. Dior ne connaissait rien à la coupe et à la couture, mais il était doué pour la création de mode.

Le New Look a inauguré un style vestimentaire totalement différent, avec une taille minuscule, une épaule arrondie et une poitrine galbée, généralement avec un décolleté plongeant et une longue jupe ample. Pour les femmes qui avaient vécu les années de guerre, la féminité du New Look a été un grand succès, car les gens en avaient assez des modes de guerre extrêmement simples et restrictives.

On dit que les robes de Dior étaient ""construites comme des bâtiments"", mais les jeunes ont été attirés par son design, et partout dans le monde occidental, les fabricants se sont lancés dans la production de son nouveau style. Les designs révolutionnaires de Dior ont illuminé tout un cycle de la mode, arrondi, doux, féminin, un plaisir dans l'élégance. Une Maison Dior du New Look a ouvert ses portes en 1948, suivie d'une autre à Londres. Considéré comme le roi de la couture (vêtements pour femmes) pendant des années, l'empire Dior s'est développé jusqu'à couvrir tous les pays du monde occidental, et comprenait les fourrures, la bonneterie, les bijoux, les parfums, les vêtements pour hommes, etc. Plus de 1 000 personnes travaillaient alors au siège parisien.

Sa mort soudaine en 1957, à l'âge de 53 ans, n'a pas stoppé la croissance de la Maison Dior. Encore aujourd'hui, tant d'années après sa mort, son nom est étroitement lié à la mode dans le monde entier, et il est en effet l'un des noms les plus reconnus au monde. Son premier grand New Look, avec ses longues jupes, était une expression de liberté à la fin des années 1940.

"Le week-end est généralement un moment de repos. Mais les adolescents chinois d'aujourd'hui ne peuvent pas se reposer le week-end. Selon une enquête, 24% des élèves de collège à Beijing ont des cours le week-end. Plus de 40% des élèves de troisième année de collège dorment moins de huit heures par nuit.

Ji Ping, une élève de troisième année de collège à Guangzhou, doit se lever à 6h30 du matin le samedi. Puis elle a une journée entière de cours. Le dimanche, elle suit des cours supplémentaires de mathématiques et d'anglais. Mais elle ne se plaint pas. Elle dit que tous ses camarades de classe travaillent dur le dimanche.

Liu Yang est originaire de Dalian. En tant qu'élève de deuxième année de collège, ses week-ends sont moins chargés. Mais il passe toujours le samedi à l'école. Le dimanche, après avoir terminé ses devoirs, il joue au basket-ball. Il se sent heureux parce qu'il a encore du temps pour faire les choses qu'il aime.

Quelques élèves ont de la chance. Yang Qing, une élève de troisième année de collège de Zibo, Shangdong, est l'une d'entre elles. Le week-end, elle se lève généralement à 8h00. Ensuite, elle passe un peu de temps à faire ses devoirs. Après cela, elle est libre de faire ce qu'elle veut. ""Ne vous mettez pas trop la pression.

"Avez-vous déjà marché jusqu'aux magasins, pour vous rendre compte en arrivant que vous aviez complètement oublié ce que vous alliez chercher ? Ou avez-vous eu du mal à vous souvenir du nom d'un vieil ami ? Pendant des années, nous avons accepté qu'un cerveau oublieux fasse autant partie du vieillissement que les rides et les cheveux gris. Mais un nouveau livre suggère que nous nous sommes _ trompés.

Selon The Secret Life Of The Grown-up Brain, de la journaliste scientifique Barbara Strauch, notre cerveau s'améliore en réalité avec l'âge. En fait, elle soutient que de nombreuses nouvelles études ont révélé que le cerveau atteint son apogée entre 40 et 60 ans, beaucoup plus tard qu'on ne le pensait auparavant.

De plus, nous ne perdons pas beaucoup de cellules cérébrales en vieillissant, nous les préservons et en produisons même de nouvelles jusqu'à la cinquantaine. Pendant des années, il a été admis que le cerveau, comme le corps, se détériorait avec l'âge. Mais la plus longue et la plus grande étude sur ce qui arrive aux gens en vieillissant suggère le contraire.

Ces recherches continues suivent 6 000 personnes depuis 1956, les testant tous les sept ans. Elles ont révélé qu'en moyenne, elles obtenaient de meilleurs résultats aux tests cognitifs à la fin de la quarantaine et dans la cinquantaine qu'à l'âge de 20 ans. Plus précisément, les personnes âgées ont obtenu de meilleurs résultats aux tests de vocabulaire, de compétences d'orientation spatiale, de mémoire verbale (nombre de mots que vous pouvez retenir) et de résolution de problèmes.

C'est en calcul (vitesse à laquelle on peut multiplier, additionner, soustraire et diviser) et en vitesse de mouvement qu'elles étaient moins performantes. Cependant, pour les tâches plus difficiles, comme la résolution de problèmes et le langage, nous sommes à notre meilleur à l'âge mûr et au-delà. En bref, les chercheurs sont sur le point de fournir des preuves scientifiques que nous devenons plus sages avec l'âge.

"Parmi les marques les plus connues au monde, on trouve Ericsson, Volvo et Ikea, toutes originaires de Suède. Ce pays nous a également offert la fermeture éclair, utilisée quotidiennement par de nombreux hommes dans le monde, selon le site d'information Swedish Wire.

Avec une population à peine supérieure à 9 millions et un produit intérieur brut (PIB) d'environ 538 milliards de dollars en 2011 - soit un treizième de celui de la Chine - la Suède semble être un candidat improbable pour un leader de l'innovation. Pourtant, ces trois dernières années, elle a constamment figuré en tête du tableau de bord de l'innovation régionale de la Commission européenne, se classant première en 2010 et 2012, et deuxième en 2011.

Les pays voisins de la Suède, dont le Danemark - célèbre pour des marques comme Nokia et Lego - sont également connus pour leurs cultures innovantes.

Comment ces pays scandinaves ont-ils réussi à réaliser ces prouesses ?

Pasi Sahlerrg, directeur général du Centre pour la mobilité internationale du ministère finlandais de l'éducation et de la culture, estime que le système éducatif est au cœur du succès des pays scandinaves. Une caractéristique clé de ce système est que l'éducation de chaque enfant est personnalisée et que les enseignants sont hautement qualifiés.

""En Finlande, 'la préparation à l'école' signifie préparer l'école à répondre aux besoins de ses élèves, plutôt que de préparer les élèves à l'école"", a déclaré Sahlerrg.

Les devoirs limités, l'absence de tests standardisés et l'absence de programme national visent à apprendre aux élèves à se gérer de manière indépendante et à organiser leur temps de manière créative - deux éléments essentiels pour encourager l'innovation.

Bien sûr, il existe des facteurs qui dépassent le système éducatif et qui déterminent également le taux d'innovation. Alors, comment imiter le succès de la Scandinavie en matière d'innovation ? Il faut favoriser une génération bien éduquée, lui fournir les ressources financières nécessaires, établir un environnement politique favorable pour qu'elle puisse transformer les idées innovantes qu'elle génère en succès.

"Ces dernières années, les progrès de la technologie médicale ont permis aux gens de vivre plus longtemps qu'auparavant. De nouveaux médicaments et machines sont développés chaque jour pour prolonger la vie. Cependant, certaines personnes, y compris certains médecins, ne sont pas en faveur de ces mesures de prolongation de la vie, et elles soutiennent que les gens devraient avoir le droit de mourir quand ils le souhaitent. Elles affirment que la qualité de vie est aussi importante que la vie elle-même et que les gens ne devraient pas être forcés à continuer à vivre lorsque les conditions de vie deviennent terribles.

"Je travaille dans un centre de soins où la plupart des personnes sont âgées. Il y a environ un an et demi, une dame de 59 ans est arrivée chez nous, atteinte d'un cancer. Elle a dû se faire amputer de la jambe droite et elle n'avait pas de famille pour s'occuper d'elle après l'opération.

Cette dame était une personne calme qui restait le plus souvent seule. Mais l'après-midi, lorsqu'elle se sentait bien, elle allait rendre visite aux autres personnes du centre de soins. Elle allait voir une dame aveugle et lui lisait des histoires. Elle allait dans la chambre d'une jeune fille atteinte de paralysie cérébrale sévère et lui chantait des chansons. Dans sa manière calme et douce, elle se déplaçait dans le centre de soins en faisant du bien.

Elle est décédée mercredi dernier et après son décès, des histoires de ses actes de gentillesse discrets en pleine détresse personnelle ont fait surface.

"Ma grand-mère était une maîtresse jardinière. Elle pouvait faire fleurir n'importe quoi, même moi. Pendant la majeure partie de sa vie, elle a vécu dans une ferme dans les montagnes de Caroline du Nord, où elle a élevé quatre enfants, enterré un mari et observé le cycle des saisons.
Après le divorce de mes parents, mon père est retourné vivre à la ferme. Je le visitais les week-ends ou les jours fériés. Pendant que mon père mangeait les légumes de ma grand-mère, j'inspirais le parfum de ses fleurs. J'étais un enfant maigre, mais ses fleurs comblaient mille endroits affamés dans mon âme. Quand mes tâches habituelles à la ferme étaient terminées, j'étais libre de grimper à la montagne, chantant des chansons et cueillant des fleurs. Parfois, les plantes me griffaient. Ma grand-mère disait : ""La beauté a un prix. J'espère que ça valait la peine.""
""Oui, madame,"" répondais-je. ""Ça valait la peine."" Puis je grattais encore. J'adorais cueillir des fleurs seul. Mais ce que j'aimais par-dessus tout, c'était les cueillir avec elle. Je marchais derrière elle comme une éponge avec des jambes, essayant d'absorber tout. À la fin de la journée, nous triions les fleurs et faisions des bouquets : un pour le salon, un pour la cuisine et trois pour les chambres. Même à l'époque, enfant, je savais que ce dont j'avais le plus besoin de ma grand-mère, ce n'était pas ses fleurs, mais son temps.

Elle est partie depuis des années, mais parfois, quand je me penche pour cueillir une fleur ou arracher une mauvaise herbe, je vois sa main, pas la mienne. Je pensais que je deviendrais aussi jardinier. Je me suis dit que, un jour, quand mes enfants auraient des enfants, je serais une grand-mère jardinière. Puis les petits-enfants ont commencé à arriver, et j'ai découvert que j'aimais beaucoup mieux courir après eux que de creuser. La vérité est que je ne suis pas jardinier. Je suis un cueilleur, pas un planteur.

Je suis différente de ma grand-mère à bien des égards, mais voilà : je porterai toujours en moi un cœur qu'elle a fait avec le sien. Ils n'ont pas besoin de planter un jardin. Mes enfants sont mes fleurs. Ils me réjouissent et m'accomplissent avec une beauté qui vaut n'importe quel prix.

Tout ce que j'ai à faire, c'est prendre soin d'eux avec du temps, les arroser d'amour et espérer qu'un jour, quand ils tiendront leur premier petit-enfant, ils pourront voir ma main.

"D'accord ! Assez de biscuits, de cola et de chips ! Il semble que la malbouffe soit tout ce que les enfants veulent manger de nos jours. La télévision contrôle leurs goûts. Les enfants voient des personnalités connues manger des croustilles, des bonbons et d'autres aliments transformés, et ils veulent être comme leurs héros. Comment le font-ils ? Ils mangent la même nourriture. J'aimerais qu'il y ait plus de personnages comme le vieux Popeye, le marin, qui mangeait des épinards et non des frites.

Maintenant, je ne m'attends pas à ce que mes enfants mangent des aliments sains parce que j'aime le riz brun, les haricots et les légumes frais.

Je ne peux pas être trop fâché contre les enfants car la plupart des adultes ne font pas attention à ce qu'ils mangent.

"DU Lala est la coach de carrière la plus en vogue du pays. Le personnage fictif du roman acclamé Du La La's Promotion montre aux autres comment prendre la voie du succès dans une entreprise multinationale. Mais son histoire décrit-elle une image réelle ou déformée de la vie professionnelle ? La réponse est aussi complexe que la vie au bureau elle-même.

Plus d'un million d'exemplaires du livre ont été vendus depuis sa sortie en 2007. Go Lala Go!, une adaptation cinématographique du roman qui sortira en salles le week-end prochain, a suscité encore plus d'intérêt pour l'histoire. Le film met en vedette Xu Jinglei et Stanley Huang, mais les fans semblent plus enthousiastes à l'idée de voir l'histoire se dérouler sur grand écran.

Selon un récent sondage de sina.com, 45 % des 6 810 internautes interrogés ont déclaré avoir tiré des conseils de carrière du roman. D'autres romans de bureau, tels que In and Out of the Loop, Win and Lose et Drowning and Floating, semblent avoir été accueillis avec un intérêt similaire.

""Ces livres me montrent la vie des cols blancs et ils m'apprennent les règles et le jargon professionnels qui ne sont pas enseignés en classe"", a déclaré Zhang Shanshan, une étudiante en dernière année de l'Université forestière de Pékin, âgée de 22 ans. Zhang affirme que la compétition, l'humour et les potins de bureau dans le livre l'ont fascinée. ""J'ai hâte de me lancer dans ma propre carrière"", a-t-elle déclaré.

La popularité des romans de bureau ne surprend pas Chen Ning, une consultante en carrière chevronnée chez Zhaopin.com. ""Les romans sur les luttes et les conflits de bureau satisfont les besoins psychologiques d'un employé de bureau ordinaire"", a déclaré Chen. ""Les personnages principaux font face à une grande pression, à une concurrence féroce et à un avenir incertain. C'est ce qui arrive vraiment dans la vie quotidienne de nombreux lecteurs.""

Li Ke, l'auteur de Du Lala's Promotion, a insisté sur l'importance de sa fiction. ""Je veux fournir aux employés de bureau du bon sens, des connaissances et des expériences réels et utiles"", a déclaré Li au Qianjiang Evening News l'année dernière.

Les récents diplômés affirment avoir trouvé les principes de travail de base mis en évidence dans le roman instructifs. ""Si ces livres avaient été publiés cinq ans plus tôt, j'aurais peut-être évité certains problèmes"", a déclaré Xu Jun, responsable des RH chez Guangqi Honda Automobile Company. ""Ils abordent souvent les principes de base du bureau, qui sont pertinents pour le personnel travaillant sous la direction intermédiaire. Ils aident également les lecteurs à comprendre l'importance de la résolution de problèmes de base et des compétences organisationnelles.""

Mais certains employés chevronnés mettent en garde contre le fait que les romans ne sont pas toujours réalistes. Ils disent que c'est particulièrement vrai pour les personnages. ""Les protagonistes semblent être imbattables"", a déclaré Hou Zhendong, responsable des RH chez General Electric. ""Le chef d'équipe de Du Lala a démissionné de manière irresponsable ; son patron est incompétent ; et le personnel qui l'entoure est soit stupide, soit trop sophistiqué. Du se distingue en cas d'urgence et prend toutes les bonnes décisions. La vérité est que les collègues de la vie réelle ne sont pas aussi polarisés"", a déclaré Hou. ""Vous avez rarement l'occasion de négocier votre salaire avec un grand patron. Et, la plupart du temps, vous prenez de mauvaises décisions bien plus souvent que de bonnes.""

Les principes de carrière présentés dans les livres sont également d'une utilité limitée. ""La plupart des histoires se déroulent dans des entreprises du Fortune 500 avec une longue histoire. Leurs cultures sont bien établies et leurs règles sont scientifiques"", a déclaré Hou. ""Mais si vous travaillez pour une petite entreprise étrangère ou une entreprise locale, certains principes sont inutiles.""

Liu Rui, chef de projet chez IBM, suggère aux fans de ces livres de se concentrer sur les petites pépites de sagesse qu'ils apportent. ""Les romans donnent aux débutants une certaine inspiration"", a-t-il déclaré. ""Ils mettent l'accent sur l'importance de l'observation, de la pratique et de l'auto-examen. Ces conseils sont précieux et universellement vrais.""

"Un nouvel âge arrive. Appelez-le comme vous voulez : l'économie des services, l'âge de l'information, la société du savoir. Tout cela se traduit par un changement fondamental dans la façon dont nous travaillons. Nous y sommes déjà en partie : le pourcentage de personnes qui gagnent leur vie en fabriquant des choses a considérablement diminué dans le monde occidental. Aujourd'hui, la majorité des emplois en Amérique, en Europe et au Japon se trouvent dans le secteur des services, et leur nombre ne cesse d'augmenter. Plus de femmes que jamais travaillent. Il y a plus d'emplois à temps partiel. Plus de gens sont travailleurs indépendants. Mais l'étendue de la transformation économique ne peut pas être mesurée uniquement par des chiffres, car elle donne également naissance à de nouvelles façons importantes de penser la nature du travail lui-même. Les idées reçues sur les emplois et les carrières, les compétences nécessaires pour réussir, voire la relation entre les individus et les employeurs, sont toutes remises en question.

Il suffit de regarder derrière nous pour avoir une idée de ce qui nous attend. Personne ne pouvait prévoir il y a 20 ans la façon dont une seule invention, la puce, transformerait notre monde grâce à ses applications dans les ordinateurs personnels, les communications numériques et les robots industriels. Les réalisations de demain en biotechnologie, en intelligence artificielle ou même en une technologie encore inimaginable pourraient produire une vague similaire de changements spectaculaires. Mais une chose est certaine : l'information et le savoir deviendront encore plus importants, et les personnes qui les possèdent, qu'elles travaillent dans la fabrication ou les services, auront l'avantage et produiront la richesse. La connaissance de l'informatique deviendra une exigence aussi fondamentale que la capacité de lire et d'écrire. La capacité à résoudre des problèmes en appliquant des informations plutôt qu'en effectuant des tâches routinières sera valorisée par-dessus tout. Si vous vous projetez 10 ans en avant, les services d'information seront supérieurs. Ce sera la façon dont vous ferez votre travail.

"C'était Noël 1961. J'enseignais dans une petite ville de l'Ohio où mes vingt-sept élèves de troisième année attendaient avec impatience le grand jour des cadeaux. 
Chaque jour, les enfants créaient une nouvelle merveille - des guirlandes de pop-corn, des décorations faites à la main et des cloches allemandes fabriquées à partir d'échantillons de papier peint, que nous accrochions au plafond. Tout au long de ces préparatifs, elle est restée indifférente, observant de loin, comme si elle était à des kilomètres. Je me demandais ce qu'il adviendrait de cette enfant silencieuse, autrefois si joyeuse, désormais si soudainement insociable. J'espérais que les festivités la raviveraient. Mais rien n'y fit.
Le jour des cadeaux arriva enfin. Nous avons poussé des ""oh"" et des ""ah"" devant notre travail manuel pendant l'échange des cadeaux. Tout au long de la journée, elle est restée assise à observer silencieusement. Je lui avais préparé un paquet spécial, rouge et vert avec de la dentelle blanche. J'avais très envie de la voir sourire. Elle l'a ouvert si lentement et avec tant de précaution. J'ai attendu, mais elle s'est détournée.
Après l'école, les enfants sont partis en petits groupes, mais elle a hésité, les regardant sortir par la porte. Je me suis assise pour reprendre mon souffle, ne sachant pas vraiment ce qui se passait, quand elle est venue vers moi, tendant les mains, tenant une petite boîte blanche, non emballée et légèrement sale, comme si elle avait été tenue de nombreuses fois par des mains enfantines non lavées. ""Pour moi ?"" ai-je demandé avec un faible sourire. Elle n'a pas dit un mot, mais elle a hoché la tête. J'ai pris la boîte et l'ai ouverte avec précaution. A l'intérieur, se trouvait une chaîne dorée. En un éclair, j'ai compris - elle l'avait faite pour sa mère, une mère qu'elle ne reverrait plus jamais, une mère qui ne la prendrait jamais dans ses bras, ne lui brosserait plus les cheveux ou ne partagerait plus d'histoires amusantes, une mère qui n'entendrait plus jamais ses joies et ses peines d'enfant, une mère qui s'était donné la mort trois semaines auparavant.
J'ai tendu la chaîne. Elle l'a prise dans ses deux mains, s'est penchée en avant et me l'a mise à l'arrière du cou. Elle a ensuite reculé, comme pour vérifier que tout allait bien. J'ai regardé la chaîne dorée, puis la donneuse, ""Maria, elle est si belle. Elle l'aurait adorée."" Aucune de nous deux n'a pu retenir ses larmes.

"Les jockeys sont les athlètes les plus petits. Ils dépassent rarement cinq pieds six pouces ou 120 livres. Plus le poids sur le cheval est léger, plus il peut aller vite. 
Monter des chevaux rapides sur la piste est dur pour les petits jockeys. Le jockey ne ""s'assoit"" pas sur le cheval. Il se penche en avant sur ses jambes. La tension est sur ses cuisses et ses mollets. Avec l'âge, les jambes des jockeys ""lâchent"" en premier. Les jockeys ont également besoin de force dans les bras. C'est une tension de tenir un cheval de course de 1000 livres.
Les jours de boue, les jockeys reçoivent des coups de boue. La boue s'envole des sabots des chevaux devant. ""On a l'impression que quelqu'un vous frappe partout"", dit un cavalier.
Et un jockey peut être blessé. Un jockey peut se faire coincer une jambe entre deux chevaux. Ou elle peut se coincer entre le cheval et la barrière. Les pires accidents sont les chutes. Un cheval peut tomber sur son cavalier. Ou les chevaux derrière peuvent piétiner s'il touche la piste. En un an, environ 240 cavaliers sont grièvement blessés. C'est un jockey sur six.
Mais les jockeys sont bien payés. Un jockey garde environ dix pour cent de l'argent que ses chevaux gagnent. Jacinto Vasquez, un jeune homme de cinq pieds trois pouces, a monté des chevaux qui ont gagné 7 000 000 $ de gains au cours des huit dernières années, ce qui signifie qu'il gagne presque 100 000 $ par an.
Pourquoi certains jockeys réussissent-ils mieux que d'autres ? ""Ce n'est pas la façon dont un garçon s'assoit sur un cheval ou utilise les rênes ou le fouet"", dit Conn McCreary. McCreary était un jockey de haut niveau dans les années 1950. Il a monté deux gagnants du Kentucky Derby. ""La plupart des jockeys font ça de la même manière. C'est le 'feeling' qu'il a pour les chevaux.""
""Quand on y pense bien, il semble que les chevaux courent mieux pour certains cavaliers"", dit McCreary. ""Un très bon jockey ne perd pas avec le meilleur cheval. Et parfois il gagnera avec le deuxième ou le troisième meilleur.""
De nombreux cavaliers latino-américains, comme Jacinto, semblent avoir le _ . ""C'est peut-être parce que nous avons grandi avec des chevaux"", dit Jacinto.

"Il existe un large choix de carrière, aussi bien vaste que profond. Qu'il s'agisse de travailler physiquement dans la construction ou de s'asseoir derrière un bureau à utiliser un ordinateur, chacun a une idée de ce qui constitue une carrière attrayante. Cependant, choisir une carrière n'est pas simplement une question de suivre un rêve ; pour la plupart des gens, cela implique beaucoup de recherches et de réflexions profondes. Choisir la bonne carrière devient l'une des décisions les plus importantes de la vie d'un individu.

Autrefois, on suivait les traces de son père ou de son grand-père ou on reprenait l'entreprise familiale lorsqu'il s'agissait de choisir une carrière. De nos jours, un parcours professionnel peut commencer n'importe où et ensuite se transformer en quelque chose de totalement différent.

Les choix de carrière doivent être réalistes et bien réfléchis. Il n'est pas rare que des personnes commencent un parcours professionnel et se rendent compte qu'elles ont fait une terrible erreur, ayant l'impression qu'il est peut-être trop tard pour faire marche arrière. Un choix de carrière ne concerne pas seulement vos compétences et vos intérêts les plus forts, mais aussi quelque chose que vous ferez en permanence pour générer des revenus. C'est pourquoi un choix de carrière peut être une décision si personnelle. Autrefois, il était inhabituel que quelqu'un change d'occupation ou de carrière plus d'une ou deux fois dans sa vie ; il est maintenant encore plus inhabituel de conserver la même carrière pendant toute sa vie professionnelle.

Il existe de nombreuses mesures pour aider à choisir la bonne profession. On peut trouver un certain nombre de sites Web offrant des outils tels que des tests de carrière et des informations, des ressources éducatives, des services de CV, etc. Il est important de faire des recherches sur sa carrière dans cette situation économique changeante et de choisir la meilleure parmi plusieurs choix de carrière connexes.

"Voici une question que j'ai souvent posée lors de dîners : 

Vous êtes sur une île avec une seule autre personne, votre meilleur ami. Il est en train de mourir d'un cancer. Dans ses derniers jours, il vous dit : ""J'ai 100 000 dollars dans une banque chez moi. Quand je mourrai, assure-toi que mon fils aille à la faculté de médecine."" Puis il meurt. Mais son fils est un playboy bon à rien qui n'a aucun intérêt à aller à la faculté de médecine et qui gaspillera cet argent en très peu de temps. Mais votre fils entre au collège et il est prêt à devenir médecin. À qui donnez-vous l'argent pour la faculté de médecine ?

J'ai posé cette question à tout le monde, du président d'une université célèbre à un jeune soldat ordinaire, et elle n'a jamais manqué de lancer une discussion. Tout le monde a une opinion, la plupart d'entre elles différentes, mais toutes justes. Parfois, ce sujet dure toute la soirée.

"Prendre des notes est une compétence qui peut vous aider à réussir dans tous vos travaux scolaires. Cela peut vous donner confiance en vous lorsque vous étudiez. Mais malheureusement, la plupart des élèves ne savent pas comment prendre des notes.

Notez les faits clés. Si votre professeur écrit des notes au tableau noir, c'est génial. Vous pouvez les copier ou noter les faits les plus importants de tout le cours. Les différents professeurs font les choses différemment. Par exemple, certains professeurs peuvent se concentrer sur de nombreuses dates et faits en classe, mais ils ne notent que les plus importants au tableau noir. D'autres professeurs peuvent ne rien écrire, mais ils peuvent répéter quelque chose d'important plusieurs fois.

Demandez. N'ayez pas peur de demander à votre professeur de répéter ce que vous avez manqué. Si votre professeur parle trop vite et que vous ne pouvez pas suivre ce qu'il dit, vous pouvez lui demander après le cours.

Comparez. Comparer vos notes avec celles de vos camarades de classe peut être bon pour votre apprentissage. Cela peut également vous aider, vous et vos camarades de classe, à corriger certaines erreurs.

Organisez. La prise de notes nécessite également de l'organisation. Gardez les notes de chaque matière dans un cahier séparé afin de pouvoir facilement trouver tout ce dont vous avez besoin lorsqu'un test arrive.

Une bonne prise de notes prend du temps. Si vous décidez de recopier vos notes tous les soirs, vous aurez sûrement moins de temps pour regarder la télévision. Mais vous gagnerez du temps lors du prochain test.

"Alors que nous vieillissons, la plupart d'entre nous nous inquiétons des cheveux gris, des rides et du maintien d'un corps jeune. Mais les gens ne réalisent souvent pas que la voix a aussi besoin d'être entretenue. Ici, M. Rubin, expert en voix, révèle comment garder votre voix jeune.

Buvez plus de liquides et évitez les aliments épicés
Vous avez besoin d'eau pour que les cordes vocales vibrent correctement. Le corps doit être suffisamment hydraté pour que les cordes vocales fonctionnent bien. Boire 1,5 litre d'eau par jour à intervalles de 15 minutes est très important. M. Rubin conseille d'éviter les aliments ayant un effet irritant sur l'estomac, tels que les oignons, le chili, les boissons gazeuses et le chocolat.

Reposez votre gorge et parlez régulièrement
Les cordes vocales peuvent être endommagées si vous utilisez votre voix pendant une mauvaise toux. Si vous souffrez de laryngite avec un rhume, vous devriez reposer votre voix pendant un jour ou deux et consulter un médecin.

Rester sociable et utiliser votre voix est très important. ""Lorsque les personnes âgées deviennent moins mobiles, elles peuvent devenir socialement isolées et parler moins"", explique M. Rubin. ""Les personnes âgées doivent communiquer davantage avec les gens. En utilisant les cordes vocales, elles permettent de ralentir le processus de vieillissement.""

Améliorez votre posture
Une bonne posture est essentielle pour garder la voix jeune, il est donc préférable de bien se tenir. L'exercice vous aide à respirer plus profondément car cela signifie qu'il y a un meilleur flux d'air à travers la boîte vocale, produisant un ton plus fort.

Chantez sous la douche
C'est l'une des meilleures façons de préserver votre voix, car cela maintient les muscles du larynx forts tandis que la vapeur lubrifie la boîte vocale. ""Chanter est de la gymnastique pour la voix"", explique M. Rubin. Rejoindre une chorale est l'un des meilleurs moyens de préserver un ton jeune.

"  Début novembre 1503, lors de son quatrième et dernier voyage en Amérique, le navire de Christophe Colomb fut gravement endommagé par une tempête. Colomb et ses hommes durent vivre sur une petite île pendant plusieurs mois tandis qu'ils tentaient de réparer leur navire et de retourner en Espagne.
Au début, les habitants de l'île furent très gentils avec les visiteurs européens, leur donnant toute la nourriture et les vêtements dont ils avaient besoin pour survivre. Cependant, au fil des mois, les habitants devinrent de plus en plus mécontents de leurs invités, qui les trompaient et leur volaient. Finalement, les habitants décidèrent d'arrêter de les aider. Sans nourriture ni moyen de quitter l'île, le groupe de Colomb se retrouva bientôt en grave difficulté.
Heureusement pour Colomb, il avait un livre sur les étoiles et les planètes sur son navire. Il décrivait les mouvements de tous les objets dans le ciel nocturne. Le livre, écrit par un scientifique allemand bien connu, indiquait qu'il y aurait une éclipse lunaire totale le soir du 29 février 1504 et combien de temps elle durerait.
Colomb calcula la différence de temps entre l'Allemagne et l'Amérique du Nord. Il organisa ensuite une rencontre avec les chefs locaux juste avant le début de l'éclipse. Lors de cette rencontre, Colomb leur expliqua que son dieu était en colère parce que les habitants ne leur donnaient plus de nourriture. Son dieu allait donc leur enlever la lune pour les punir. Au moment où Colomb termina de parler, comme il l'avait prévu, la lune commença à disparaître.
Les chefs locaux furent effrayés et acceptèrent rapidement de fournir à Colomb de la nourriture et tout ce qu'il voulait. Mais d'abord, le dieu de Colomb devait rendre la lune. Colomb leur dit qu'il devait en discuter avec son dieu sur son navire. Sachant que la lune resterait complètement cachée pendant environ 48 minutes, Colomb retourna juste avant que la lune ne commence à réapparaître. À partir de ce jour, jusqu'à ce qu'ils quittent enfin l'île, Colomb et ses hommes n'eurent plus aucun problème à obtenir la nourriture dont ils avaient besoin.

"Dire que nous vivons dans un monde de persuasion signifie que nous vivons parmi des intérêts concurrents. Le besoin de votre colocataire d'étudier pour un examen prime sur la pizza. Votre professeur peut avoir de bonnes raisons de ne pas changer votre note. Et l'objet de votre intérêt romantique peut avoir d'autres choix.

Dans un tel monde, la persuasion est l'art d'amener les autres à accorder une attention juste et favorable à nos points de vue. Lorsque nous persuadons, nous voulons influencer ce que les autres croient et comment ils se comportent. Nous ne prévalons pas toujours - d'autres points de vue peuvent être plus convaincants, selon l'auditeur, la situation et le bien-fondé de l'affaire. Mais lorsque nous pratiquons l'art de la persuasion, nous essayons de nous assurer que notre position reçoit l'attention qu'elle mérite.

Cependant, certaines personnes s'opposent à l'idée même de persuasion. Ils peuvent la considérer comme une approche indésirable de leur vie ou comme un contrôle. En revanche, nous pensons que la persuasion est inévitable - vivre, c'est persuader. La persuasion peut être morale ou immorale, altruiste ou égoïste, inspirante ou décourageante. Les personnes qui persuadent peuvent éclairer nos esprits ou nous faire souffrir. La persuasion morale, cependant, fait appel à un raisonnement solide et est sensible aux sentiments et aux besoins des auditeurs. Une telle persuasion peut nous aider à appliquer la sagesse du passé aux décisions que nous devons maintenant prendre. Par conséquent, une partie essentielle de l'éducation est d'apprendre à résister à un type de persuasion et à encourager et à pratiquer l'autre.

Au-delà de son importance personnelle pour nous, la persuasion est un besoin pour la société. Le droit de persuader et d'être persuadé est le principe fondamental du système politique américain.

"C'était votre anniversaire, et vous venez d'ouvrir votre plus gros cadeau : un ordinateur portable argenté et lisse. Vous avez hâte de le faire savoir à vos amis en leur envoyant un message instantané, mais d'abord, vous devez vous débarrasser de votre vieux ordinateur de bureau. Est-ce que vous allez simplement jeter le moniteur et le clavier à la poubelle ? Plus maintenant !

Trois États, à savoir la Californie, le Maine et le Maryland, ont récemment adopté des lois interdisant aux gens de jeter les déchets électroniques, ou e-déchets, qui comprennent les téléviseurs, les ordinateurs et les téléphones portables. Bien qu'ils ne vous rendent pas malade lorsque vous les utilisez, ils le font lorsqu'ils sont détruits, car ils contiennent des métaux lourds qui peuvent être nocifs pour le corps humain. Par exemple, les batteries de téléphones portables contiennent une sorte de produit chimique qui endommage les reins et les moniteurs d'ordinateur abandonnés peuvent endommager le cerveau. Et les écrans de télévision plats peuvent causer des dommages au système nerveux. Ces métaux peuvent s'infiltrer dans le sol ou dégager des polluants lorsqu'ils sont brûlés.

Il est obligatoire de placer les e-déchets dans des sites spéciaux plutôt que dans les décharges ordinaires. Plusieurs autres États envisagent des lois similaires et la Californie fait également pression pour une loi interdisant l'application de ces substances dangereuses.

Les responsables gouvernementaux ne sont pas les seuls à cibler les e-déchets ; les environnementalistes exhortent également les gens à recycler leurs équipements obsolètes.

""C'est tout simplement un gaspillage... de ne pas recycler"", a déclaré Patrick, professeur agrégé de santé professionnelle et environnementale à l'université de l'Iowa, au Daily Iowan, ""Laisser des produits chimiques dangereux s'infiltrer dans l'environnement pendant des décennies semble irresponsable.""

Que pouvez-vous faire ?

Réduire. Soyez un acheteur responsable et prenez soin de vos appareils électroniques afin qu'ils durent plus longtemps.

Réutiliser. Faites don ou vendez votre vieux matériel de haute technologie.

Recycler. Pour trouver un recycleur responsable, contactez un groupe environnemental local ou étatique.

"J'évite toujours de participer aux enquêtes de terrain avec l'équipe des toxiques, sauf si c'est absolument nécessaire. Ce n'est pas que je craigne le travail dur ou que j'aie peur d'être en contact avec des substances toxiques. Ce que je redoute, c'est de perdre rapidement espoir dans le travail que je fais.

Cependant, lorsque je fais des recherches de terrain avec l'équipe des toxiques, tout ce que je vois et ressens, c'est la saleté, rien d'autre. Même si je ferme les yeux, je sens l'odeur du traitement des aliments, des déchets organiques en décomposition provenant des usines de papier et des produits chimiques provenant des fabricants de vêtements.

Un matin, je suis allé enquêter sur un tuyau de décharge pour documenter et collecter des échantillons de polluants émis secrètement par une usine textile. J'ai dû travailler dans le plus grand secret afin d'éviter d'être découvert par l'usine textile.

J'ai plongé une longue perche de mesure dans le grand tuyau polluant pour mesurer le volume d'eau polluée émise. Mais la surface de l'eau, recouverte de pétrole et de saleté, me donnait envie de vomir.

Soudain, j'ai senti quelqu'un me taper dans le dos. J'ai tellement été effrayé que j'ai failli tomber à l'eau. Je me suis agrippé à la perche et j'ai regardé derrière moi pour voir un vieil homme debout là. Il a demandé : ""On peut pêcher ici ?""

Il était clair qu'il passait juste par là, alors j'ai répondu : ""Ouais, la survie du plus apte. Les poissons qui s'adaptent peuvent survivre, tout comme les humains.""

Ils donnent souvent des informations sur leur sujet, comme des écrivains célèbres, des Amérindiens ou des jardins de fleurs. 

Il existe des calendriers sur la nourriture, sur de beaux endroits du monde, sur le sport, sur le cinéma. Des calendriers amusants avec des personnages de dessins animés populaires. Pour les amoureux des animaux, il existe des calendriers avec des photos de chats faisant des choses insolites. Trois cent soixante-cinq d'entre eux, un pour chaque jour de l'année. Il existe aussi des calendriers avec des photos de voitures. Il y a même des calendriers pour les enfants qui peuvent dessiner les images eux-mêmes.

Certaines personnes ne se contentent pas de regarder leurs calendriers.

"  Révélées au monde par le célèbre explorateur britannique, le Dr David Livingstone, en 1855, les chutes Victoria sont l'une des merveilles naturelles les plus connues d'Afrique. Elles constituent une frontière naturelle entre le Zimbabwe et la Zambie.
Les chutes portent le nom de la reine Victoria par Livingstone. Elles étaient connues des peuples autochtones au 18ème siècle sous le nom de : « la fumée qui gronde ». La cascade se forme lorsque la rivière Zambèze, large de deux kilomètres, se déverse sur le bord de son gigantesque lit de pierre et se précipite dans les gorges en contrebas. À leur point le plus haut, les chutes Victoria chutent d'une distance de 108 m, soit presque deux fois la hauteur des chutes du Niagara. Jusqu'à 546 millions de mètres cubes d'eau par minute se déversent du haut de cette hauteur.
En regardant les chutes du côté zambien, les visiteurs peuvent emprunter un sentier qui les conduit jusqu'aux chutes. Les chutes peuvent également être observées depuis le Boiling Pot, en plein cœur des gorges, au pied des chutes. Le pont Victoria Falls, haut de 111 mètres, un passage ferroviaire, est aujourd'hui un lieu populaire pour le saut à l'élastique. On peut le traverser à pied pour une vue imprenable sur les chutes et les eaux bleu-vert sinueuses de la rivière Zambèze. Il est également possible de voir les chutes depuis un avion.
La région autour des chutes est un lieu majeur d'observation de la faune. La meilleure période pour observer les chutes Victoria est entre décembre et juillet, lorsque le niveau de l'eau est le plus élevé.

"C'est une situation familière à tous les parents de jeunes enfants : vous êtes dans une rue commerçante animée et votre enfant a besoin de faire pipi, mais il ne peut plus se retenir. Cependant, la décision de deux parents de laisser leur enfant se soulager a suscité beaucoup d'attention en Chine.

Aujourd'hui, il semble que toute la Chine soit au courant de ce qui s'est passé dans une rue commerçante bondée de Hong Kong. Une mère tient une couche tandis que son enfant de deux ans urine. Un passant a pris des photos qui ont ensuite été publiées en ligne. La femme a expliqué qu'ils avaient trouvé des toilettes publiques mais qu'il y avait une longue file d'attente, elle n'avait donc pas d'autre choix que de laisser son enfant se soulager dans la rue.

Pourquoi cet acte d'un enfant a-t-il provoqué tant de mécontentement ? En effet, à Hong Kong, il est interdit par la loi de "" _ dans une rue publique"" à un enfant de moins de 12 ans, les parents risquant une amende de 2 000 dollars de Hong Kong (250 dollars américains) . Mais les conversations en ligne ont mis l'accent sur le fait que cette famille était des touristes de Chine continentale, plutôt que des locaux. ""Pour les Hongkongais, les gens peuvent penser de temps en temps que les Chinois continentaux ne sont pas si polis et enfreignent souvent les règles publiques"", explique Martin Yip de la BBC. Charmaine Chui, née à Hong Kong, a déclaré à la BBC qu'elle était en colère de voir des touristes de Chine continentale uriner dans des centres commerciaux et des restaurants. ""Hong Kong est une ville magnifique et moderne. Que pensent ces gens de la ville ?"" dit-elle.

En Chine continentale, le comportement des parents a également été critiqué. Mais la plupart des gens trouvent leur comportement compréhensible, car ils ont essayé de trouver des toilettes pour leur enfant et la mère a utilisé une couche en papier plutôt que de simplement laisser le bébé uriner sur le sol.

"Pourquoi semble-t-il que tous les enfants d'aujourd'hui sont gagnants de quelque chose, alors que nous savons que tous les enfants ne peuvent pas être des stars ? De nos jours, les enfants sont d'abord divisés par âge, puis par réalisation et souvent par le type de performance.

La culture américaine en général a de plus en plus accepté les prix et les récompenses. La tradition des prix « gagnant prend tout » qui caractérise la culture américaine a débuté au début du XXe siècle avec le développement de la culture sportive américaine organisée. Dans la seconde moitié du XXe siècle, l'attention portée à la compétition et aux classements en général s'est accrue rapidement. Les années 1970 ont connu la création du plus grand nombre de prix, y compris l'ajout d'encore plus de prix dans des domaines tels que le cinéma et la littérature. Les concours de musique, y compris l'introduction des American Music Awards, ont connu une croissance similaire au cours de cette période. Depuis lors, les prix sont devenus de plus en plus à la mode, de même que les activités compétitives des enfants.

Si les récompenses peuvent aider les gens à se fixer des objectifs et à pratiquer leur activité, elles peuvent aussi être une pratique commerciale. Les trophées permettent de s'assurer que les clients reviennent année après année. Garder les enfants, les parents, les enseignants et les entraîneurs heureux avec beaucoup de reconnaissance permet aux organisateurs des compétitions de continuer à recevoir des fonds.

Les trophées peuvent inciter les enfants à revenir, et leurs parents à payer, mais la recherche a révélé que donner des trophées aux enfants pour avoir participé à une activité entraîne des niveaux d'encouragement plus faibles. Les niveaux élevés d'encouragement sont exactement ce que nous voulons favoriser chez les enfants pour les aider à réussir à long terme et à être fiers d'une réussite bien méritée. Les parents doivent donc faire attention lorsqu'ils essaient d'obtenir des titres pour leurs jeunes enfants, et s'assurer que l'honneur créé est pour leurs enfants et non pour les éloges de toute autre personne dans la vie de leurs enfants.

"Geoff Hoon est l'un des politiciens les plus expérimentés de Grande-Bretagne.

M. Hoon a rejoint le ministère des Affaires étrangères et du Commonwealth en mai 1999 en tant que ministre d'État responsable de l'Asie, du Pacifique, du Moyen-Orient et de l'Afrique du Nord ; il a ensuite été nommé ministre pour l'Europe. Plus tard, en 1999, M. Hoon a rejoint le cabinet de Tony Blair en tant que secrétaire d'État à la Défense, où il a supervisé quatre déploiements majeurs de troupes britanniques, y compris en Irak. Après les élections générales de 2005, il est devenu leader de la Chambre des communes et, plus tôt cette année (2006), il a été nommé à nouveau ministre pour l'Europe.

Le vendredi 24 novembre, M. Hoon se rend à Nottingham pour s'adresser au Forum. Il parlera de son expérience sous les feux de la rampe et expliquera à quoi ressemble réellement la vie d'un ministre du cabinet.

Il y aura une possibilité de poser des questions après la conférence, qui est ouverte à tous les étudiants et membres du personnel de l'Université de Nottingham. Veuillez arriver tôt car les places sont limitées et personne ne sera admis une fois l'événement commencé.

"Dans la Chine antique, les gens changeaient leur chance en passant l'examen Keju, qui a débuté sous la dynastie Sui et a duré 1300 ans avant d'être aboli sous la dynastie Qing. Le Keju, l'ancien ""gaokao"", jouait un rôle crucial dans la sélection de personnes qualifiées pour servir le roi.

Les examens Keju étaient principalement basés sur la littérature classique et la philosophie. La poésie était très importante dans les premiers examens Keju, tandis que les examens ultérieurs se concentraient davantage sur l'écriture. Tous les candidats devaient rédiger un article expliquant les idées de ces livres, appelé Essai en huit parties. Deux phrases étaient requises au début de l'article, concernant l'idée principale du titre, ce qui était appelé ""clarifier le sujet"". Les examens portaient également sur des questions plus pratiques.

La plupart des candidats dans la Chine antique devaient parcourir un long chemin pour se rendre à la capitale afin de passer l'examen. Comme les transports dans l'Antiquité n'étaient pas développés, ils se rendaient généralement à la capitale à pied, et certains mettaient plusieurs mois pour y parvenir.

L'examen avait lieu tous les trois ans et se composait de quatre niveaux : l'examen du comté, l'examen provincial, l'examen de l'académie et l'examen du palais. Les candidats devaient d'abord réussir un niveau pour pouvoir participer au niveau suivant. Chaque examen durait de un à trois jours et les candidats étaient enfermés dans une petite pièce et recevaient des repas froids.

Le jour de l'examen, les candidats devaient d'abord passer un contrôle de sécurité. Ils devaient laisser leurs cheveux détachés pour qu'ils puissent être vérifiés, et leurs jambes de pantalon, leurs chaussures et leurs chaussettes, voire leurs fesses, étaient également contrôlées.

"Alsten Chase a écrit un livre sur le parc national de Yellowstone. Il s'inquiète des dommages que les incendies peuvent causer au parc. Il est également préoccupé par les règles du parc. Ces règles stipulent que la nature doit décider de ce qui arrive au parc. Alsten écrit également que le troupeau d'élans a grandi trop gros. Les élans marchent sur les rives des rivières. Ils mangent l'herbe nouvelle et les racines des jeunes arbres. Les castors ont besoin des arbres pour construire des barrages. Les barrages augmentent les niveaux d'eau. Des niveaux d'eau plus élevés mettent plus d'eau dans le sol. Un sol humide aide les plantes à pousser plus vite. Les plantes offrent des maisons et de la nourriture à d'autres animaux. Chase pense que les règles du parc ne fonctionneraient que dans un parc avec des paramètres naturels. Il pense que Yellowstone a un environnement artificiel depuis longtemps. Les peuples autochtones ont quitté les lieux. Les loups ont été emmenés et d'autres animaux ont été enlevés. Les zones de terre ont été clôturées et d'autres animaux ont été ajoutés. Il pense que les règles du parc qui laissent les troupeaux grossir trop et les incendies brûler nuisent à la nature du parc. Le responsable du parc pense que les règles sont bonnes et que le parc va bien. Chase pense que la façon dont les gens gèrent le parc devrait être modifiée.

"Un soir d'été, Ludwig Beethoven se promenait dans la banlieue de Bonn. Soudain, un vent doux s'est levé. Il a entendu de la musique. Il a écouté attentivement et a constaté qu'il s'agissait de sa sonate en fa. Il a suivi la musique et est arrivé devant une petite maison. À travers la fenêtre, il a vu une jeune fille jouer d'un très vieux piano et un jeune homme fabriquer des chaussures à côté d'elle. Il a poussé la porte et est entré. L'hôte l'a reçu très chaleureusement et lui a dit que la jeune fille était sa sœur, qui était aveugle mais très passionnée par la musique. Ils n'avaient pas les moyens de l'envoyer chez un maître. Elle essayait donc simplement de jouer de la musique qu'elle avait entendu jouer par les voisins. Elle savait qu'il s'agissait de l'œuvre d'un grand compositeur. Beethoven a été très ému. Soudain, la bougie s'est éteinte. Le clair de lune a frappé la silhouette élancée de la jeune fille. Puis Beethoven a joué de la musique pour eux. Il a joué si merveilleusement que le frère et la sœur ont été émerveillés. C'était son célèbre Clair de lune.

"""Une femme ne peut jamais être trop riche ou trop mince."" Cette phrase, souvent attribuée à la défunte Duchesse de Windsor, représente une grande partie de l'esprit étrange de notre époque. Être mince est considéré comme une vertu.

Le problème avec une telle vision est que certaines personnes essaient réellement de vivre selon cette maxime. Moi-même, je nourris des fantasmes de me glisser dans des vêtements de créateur étroits. Par conséquent, j'ai suivi un régime pendant la majeure partie de ma vie, pour le meilleur ou pour le pire. Être riche ne serait pas mauvais non plus, mais cela n'arrivera pas à moins qu'un inconnu ne décède soudainement dans une terre lointaine, me léguant des millions de dollars.

Où avons-nous déraillé ? Quand est-ce que manger du beurre est devenu un péché, et un peu de chair supplémentaire, déplaisant, voire désagréable ? Toutes les religions ont des jours où les gens s'abstiennent de manger, et la gourmandise est l'un des sept péchés capitaux du christianisme. Cependant, jusqu'à récemment, la plupart des gens avaient du mal à avoir assez à manger. Dans certains groupes religieux, la richesse était un symbole de morale élevée probable, et la corpulence, un signe de richesse et de bien-être.

Aujourd'hui, c'est le contraire qui est vrai. Nous avons fait de la minceur notre nouvelle marque de vertu. Le résultat est que d'être gros - ou même simplement en surpoids - est mauvais car cela implique un manque de force morale.

Notre obsession pour la minceur est également alimentée par des préoccupations de santé. Il est vrai que dans ce pays, nous avons plus de personnes en surpoids que jamais auparavant, et que dans de nombreux cas, le surpoids est corrélé à un risque accru de maladies cardiaques et vasculaires. Cependant, ces maladies peuvent avoir autant à voir avec notre mode de vie et nos régimes riches en graisses qu'avec un excès de poids. Et le risque associé de cancer du système digestif peut être davantage un problème alimentaire - trop de graisse et un manque de fibres - qu'un problème de poids.

La vraie préoccupation, alors, n'est pas que nous pesions trop lourd, mais que nous ne faisons pas assez d'exercice et que nous ne mangeons pas bien. L'exercice est nécessaire pour des os solides et la santé du cœur et des poumons. Une alimentation équilibrée sans trop de matières grasses peut également aider l'organisme à éviter de nombreuses maladies. Nous devrions sûrement arrêter de prêter autant d'attention au poids. Être simplement mince ne suffit pas. C'est en fait dangereux si ceux qui deviennent (ou sont déjà) minces pensent qu'ils sont automatiquement en bonne santé et donc dispensés de prêter attention à leur style de vie global. La minceur peut être une pure vanité.

"Si nous trouvons un nid d'oiseau, nous aurons un bon endroit pour observer et en apprendre davantage sur les oiseaux. Les oiseaux couvent leurs œufs et s'occupent de leurs petits d'avril à juin. Comme les oisillons sont trop jeunes pour quitter le nid, les parents vont souvent chercher de la nourriture et reviennent au bout de quelques minutes. Il est donc intéressant d'observer les oiseaux. Lorsque nous observons les oiseaux, il est préférable de nous cacher dans un endroit proche du nid et d'utiliser des jumelles.

Mais comment fait-on un nid d'oiseau ? Un bon nid d'oiseau doit être très fin, solide, épais et confortable. Si vous souhaitez en fabriquer un, suivez ces étapes :

a) Chaque nid doit avoir six planches pour son toit et son sol, pour ses côtés gauche et droit et pour ses côtés avant et arrière. Ne faites pas les planches trop glissantes.

b) Creusez un petit trou à l'avant du nid pour faire une ""porte"". La ""porte"" est suffisamment grande pour que les oiseaux puissent entrer et sortir facilement.

c) Assurez-vous que l'eau de pluie ne peut pas pénétrer dans le nid.

d) Une des planches doit être facile à ouvrir.

e) N'oubliez pas de colorier le nid.

"Des gants neufs, à la fois originaux et chers, permettent aux bavards de donner un nouveau sens à l'expression ""mains libres"" en leur permettant de parler dans leurs gants lorsqu'ils passent un appel.

Ces gants, connus sous le nom de ""Talk to the Hand"", coûtent 1 000 £ la paire. Ils sont dotés d'un haut-parleur intégré au pouce et d'un microphone intégré à l'auriculaire, pouvant être connectés à tout appareil mobile via Bluetooth. L'artiste Sean Miles a conçu ces gants qui font également office de téléphone dans le cadre de son projet visant à démontrer les possibilités de recyclage des appareils électroniques. Il combine des gants avec des pièces provenant d'appareils mobiles recyclés via O2, qui a commandé le projet.

Les utilisateurs de téléphones mobiles pourront garder leurs mains au chaud tout en discutant sans avoir à sortir leur téléphone de leur poche ou de leur sac à main.

M. Miles a conçu deux paires de ces nouveaux gants : une en rose et l'autre en brun et jaune. Ils seront exposés lors d'une exposition en juillet et les visiteurs pourront gagner les gants. Si la demande est forte, ils seront ensuite produits à plus grande échelle.

O2 Recycle, qui soutient le projet, estime qu'il existe déjà 70 millions d'appareils mobiles inutilisés au Royaume-Uni. Le service paie les personnes qui recyclent des appareils électroniques, notamment des téléphones, des lecteurs MP3 et des appareils photo numériques.

Le designer Scan Miles espère que son travail incitera les gens à réfléchir au recyclage. L'homme de 41 ans a déclaré : ""J'espère que mon projet Talk to the Hand incitera les gens à réfléchir à nouveau aux déchets générés par le non-recyclage des appareils électroniques. Si quelques personnes de plus recyclent leurs appareils au lieu de les envoyer à la décharge, je pense que ce projet aura atteint son objectif.""

Les gants de téléphone portable Talk to the Hand sont le deuxième produit d'une série créée par O2 Recycle et Miles. Miles travaille actuellement sur la combinaison de téléphones avec des sacs à main, afin que les gens ne perdent plus de temps à fouiller dans leurs sacs pour trouver un téléphone lorsqu'il sonne.

"J'ai passé trois mois à faire du bénévolat avec Volunteer Bolivia. C'était parfois agaçant, effrayant et difficile, mais aussi bouleversant, satisfaisant et incroyable. Étant donné que j'avais étudié l'espagnol pendant quelques années avant de partir, j'ai suivi un cours d'une semaine seulement chez Volunteer Bolivia.

Vivre avec une famille a également beaucoup amélioré mon espagnol et j'ai immédiatement eu l'impression d'être l'une de leurs filles. Nous étions de bonnes amies dès le début de mon séjour là-bas et j'ai été très bien entourée. J'avais quand même beaucoup d'indépendance. Le centre Volunteer Bolivia, avec son café-bar et ses conférences culturelles, était un lieu de rencontre pour tous les bénévoles et j'ai rencontré des gens formidables du monde entier qui faisaient la même chose que moi : donner quelque chose de soi à un pays qui en a tant besoin.

Mon travail consistait à travailler dans un centre d'accueil pour les enfants de prisonniers des prisons de Cochabamba. Dès le début, je me suis sentie accueillie et nécessaire. J'y ai rencontré des membres inspirants qui ont mis tant de leur cœur à s'occuper de ces enfants qui n'avaient peut-être personne d'autre pour les aimer. Non seulement le travail lui-même était très difficile, mais il était aussi parfois émotionnellement exigeant, en particulier le moment de ramener un groupe de deux ans à la prison à la fin de la journée. Malgré tout cela, j'ai beaucoup appris à travers cette expérience et je suis maintenant plus consciente des problèmes auxquels de nombreuses personnes sont confrontées quotidiennement en Amérique du Sud. Le centre est très peu financé, ce qui le rend fortement dépendant du travail des bénévoles, et tout le temps que les gens donnent est précieux pour eux.

Depuis mon retour en Grande-Bretagne, je suis restée en contact avec les personnes avec qui j'ai travaillé et j'essaie de les soutenir autant que possible. Le bénévolat par l'intermédiaire de Volunteer Bolivia a changé ma vie et est une expérience que je n'oublierai jamais.

"Si tu penses être trop timide et que tu veux être un peu plus extraverti, essaie ce qui suit. Tu peux y arriver.

Dis aux gens que tu es timide. Fais-leur savoir que tu es un enfant timide. Lorsqu'ils le sauront, ils te comprendront mieux. Cela t'aidera également à te sentir plus à l'aise lorsque tu parles aux autres.

Essaie de sourire plus souvent. Les gens penseront que tu es amical et facile à aborder. Souviens-toi que la plupart d'entre nous aiment parler à des gens sympathiques et que nous éviterons un visage qui semble en colère.

Parle aux autres en premier. Si tu trouves cela difficile à faire, dis quelque chose de gentil sur les personnes qui t'entourent. Réfléchis à la sensation agréable que tu ressens lorsqu'une personne te dit quelque chose de gentil. Cela ne te donne-t-il pas envie de continuer à parler à ces personnes ?

Détourne ton attention vers autre chose. Pense plutôt à des façons de profiter de la fête ou du jeu. Ne t'inquiète pas pour ton apparence ou si les gens t'aiment.

Récompense-toi. Chaque fois que tu dis ""bonjour"" ou que tu souris à quelqu'un pour la première fois, dis-toi ""Tu l'as fait !"" ou achète-toi une glace.

"Un matin à Philadelphie, le soleil brillait avec force à travers la jungle épaisse et les hautes églises. John, 6 ans, vêtu de vêtements usés, marchait de loin, ses petites mains sombres serrant un morceau de pain volé.

John s'arrêta un instant à l'entrée de la sainte église, puis repartit en serrant fermement le pain. Il était orphelin, ses parents ayant été tués pendant la Seconde Guerre mondiale, le laissant seul à l'orphelinat pendant cinq ans. Comme beaucoup d'enfants de l'orphelinat, il avait beaucoup de temps libre. La plupart du temps, personne ne s'occupait d'eux, alors ils ont dû apprendre à voler ce qu'ils voulaient.

John croyait en l'existence de Dieu, alors chaque dimanche matin, quoi qu'il arrive, il allait à l'église pour regarder et écouter les gens chanter à l'intérieur ou réciter la Bible. Il ne se sentait enfant de Dieu et si proche de Dieu que pendant ce moment. Mais il ne pouvait pas entrer parce que ses vêtements étaient si sales. John le savait lui-même.

John comptait silencieusement. C'était son 45ème dimanche à l'entrée de l'église. Il se tenait sur la pointe des pieds un moment, puis s'en alla.

Au fil du temps, le pasteur remarqua John et apprit des autres qu'il était le petit garçon qui aimait voler des choses à l'orphelinat.

Le 46ème dimanche, le soleil brillait et John arriva toujours en serrant un morceau de pain dans ses petites mains sombres. Lorsqu'il se tenait simplement là, le pasteur sortit. Il avait envie de s'enfuir, mais il fut porté par le sourire amical du pasteur.

Le pasteur s'approcha de lui, voyant clairement les petites mains de John trembler.

""C'est toi, John ?""

John ne répondit pas, mais regarda le pasteur et hocha la tête.

""Tu crois en Dieu ?"" le pasteur caressa la tête de John, tachée de poussière.

""Oui, je crois !"" Cette fois, John lui répondit à voix haute.

""Alors tu crois en toi-même ?""

John regarda le pasteur, sans dire un mot.

Le pasteur poursuivit : ""Dès que je t'ai vu, j'ai trouvé que tu étais différent des autres enfants, parce que tu as un bon cœur.""

Le visage rouge, John dit timidement : ""En fait, je suis un voleur."" Sur ces mots, il baissa la tête.

Le pasteur ne parla pas, mais prit les petites mains sombres de John, les ouvrit lentement et les plaça contre son visage ridé.

""Ah !"" Au même moment, John cria et s'apprêta à retirer ses petites mains sombres. Mais le pasteur les tenait fermement et les écarta au soleil.

""Tu vois, John ?""

""Quoi ?""

""Tu tiens le soleil dans tes mains.""

John regarda ses mains d'un air vide : quand sont-elles devenues si belles ?

""Aux yeux de Dieu, tous les enfants sont égaux. Lorsqu'ils sont prêts à tendre la main pour saluer le soleil, le soleil brillera naturellement sur eux. Et tu as deux choses de plus qu'eux. La première, c'est le courage, et la seconde, c'est la gentillesse."" Sur ces mots, le pasteur le conduisit dans l'église.

C'était la première fois que John entrait dans ce lieu sacré, et à cet instant, il ne se sentait pas inférieur, mais une chaleur indescriptible.

Ce matin-là, en accueillant le soleil, John se retrouva, avec la confiance, la satisfaction, le bonheur, les rêves qu'il n'avait jamais eus.

Vingt ans se sont écoulés. Le garçon qui tenait fermement le pain dans ses mains sales est devenu le chef le plus célèbre de Philadelphie et a créé de nombreux plats populaires.

Chaque dimanche matin, il envoyait personnellement le pain qu'il avait préparé à l'orphelinat. Les enfants qui l'accueillaient avec des acclamations avaient pris l'habitude de tendre consciemment leurs paumes avant de recevoir le pain.

Parce qu'ils savaient tous que lorsque nous sommes prêts à tendre la main pour saluer le soleil, le soleil brillera naturellement sur nous.

"Lorsque l'on évoque les caractéristiques uniques de Pékin, le style des hutongs vient immédiatement à l'esprit. Il n'est pas exagéré de dire que l'histoire de la ville vit au sein des hutongs.

Le mot hutong a été emprunté au mongol il y a environ 700 ans et signifiait ""puits d'eau"". Par la suite, il a désigné un lieu d'habitation. Les hutongs que nous voyons aujourd'hui sont constitués de petites ruelles formées par les murs de siheyuan. Ils ont été construits pendant les dynasties Yuan, Ming et Qing.

Lorsque la République populaire de Chine a été fondée en 1949, il y avait plus de 3 000 hutongs. La majeure partie de la population de la ville vivait dans ces logements traditionnels. Mais avec la modernisation de la ville dans les années 1980 et au début des années 1990, de nombreux hutongs ont été détruits pour construire des routes, des gratte-ciel et des maisons modernes.

Le gouvernement a reconnu l'importance des hutongs pour le patrimoine culturel chinois. En 2002, Pékin a inscrit 40 zones historiques protégées et a intensifié ses efforts pour restaurer certains vestiges clés et rues anciennes de la ville. Près de 500 hutongs ont survécu.

Les hutongs qui existent encore sont comme des oasis de calme au milieu de la ville bruyante. En se promenant dans ces ruelles, il est courant de voir des groupes de personnes âgées assises ensemble à jouer aux cartes, au mahjong ou aux échecs chinois. Tôt le matin et le soir, ils se rassemblent pour pratiquer des formes d'exercices traditionnelles comme le taijiquan, ainsi que pour danser et chanter des chansons folkloriques ou de l'opéra de Pékin. Les hutongs sont devenus un musée des coutumes populaires et de l'histoire de Pékin.

Bali est située juste au large de la côte orientale de l'île principale indonésienne de Java. À l'est se trouve l'île voisine de Lombok. Au sud de Bali se trouve l'étendue de l'océan Indien, tandis qu'au nord se trouve la mer de Bali. La station balnéaire la plus populaire auprès des vacanciers est Ubud, au nord de Sanur.

Quand y aller ?
Bali a un climat tropical toute l'année avec une température moyenne quotidienne de 31°C (87°F). La saison des pluies s'étend d'octobre à avril. La saison sèche s'étend de mai à septembre et est la période la plus fréquentée pour visiter l'île car les voyageurs profitent des longues journées chaudes et des faibles précipitations.

Plage
Bali possède une succession de plages, principalement dans le sud de l'île. Sortez des plages de Bali et un monde totalement différent vous attend. Ubud est une ville balnéaire de jungle facilement accessible avec une bonne gamme d'hôtels, de boutiques et de restaurants. Le volcan actif du mont Batur est un point culminant, tout comme les lacs de montagne.

Plaisir en famille
Tous les resorts ont de nombreuses installations pour les familles. À Ubud, il y a un parc aux singes, où les plus jeunes peuvent voir des singes qui ne sont pas gardés dans de petites cages, et un parc aux éléphants où les vacanciers peuvent monter à dos d'éléphant.

Manger dehors
Tous les resorts de Bali proposent une cuisine internationale pour tous les goûts, la plupart des hôtels de qualité supérieure ayant d'excellents restaurants. La bière indonésienne Bintang est très populaire.

Se déplacer
Il existe un nombre limité de bus locaux. L'autre moyen de transport public est de prendre les minibus locaux ""bemo"". Ces petits minibus colorés filent sur les routes sinueuses avec des tarifs négociés à bord, il est donc utile de parler un peu la langue locale. Il y a aussi des taxis et des vélos électriques et des voitures peuvent être loués.

"Les anniversaires sont souvent synonymes de surprises. Mais la surprise de cette année pour l'anniversaire du grand dramaturge anglais William Shakespeare est sans aucun doute l'une des plus spectaculaires.

Le 22 avril, un jour avant le 441e anniversaire de sa naissance, des experts ont découvert qu'un des portraits les plus reconnaissables de William Shakespeare était un faux. Cela signifie que nous n'avons plus de réelle idée de ce à quoi Shakespeare ressemblait. ""Il est très possible que de nombreuses images de Shakespeare soient peu fiables car beaucoup d'entre elles sont des copies de celle-ci"", a déclaré un expert de la National Portrait Gallery de Grande-Bretagne.

Cette découverte intervient après quatre mois de tests utilisant des rayons X, la lumière ultraviolette, la microphotographie et des échantillons de peinture. Les experts de la galerie affirment que l'image, communément appelée le ""Portrait à la fleur"", a en réalité été peinte dans les années 1800, environ deux siècles après la mort de Shakespeare. Les experts en art qui travaillent à la galerie affirment avoir également utilisé des technologies de chimie moderne pour analyser la peinture du tableau. Ces vérifications ont révélé des traces de peinture datant d'environ 1814. Shakespeare est mort en 1616, et la date qui figure sur le portrait est 1609.

""Nous pensons maintenant que le portrait date d'environ 1818 à 1840. C'est à cette époque qu'il y a eu un regain d'intérêt pour les pièces de Shakespeare"", a déclaré Tarnya Cooper, conservatrice de la galerie, à l'Associated Press.

La fausse image a souvent été utilisée comme couverture pour des recueils de ses pièces. Elle est appelée le Portrait à la fleur parce que l'un de ses propriétaires, Desmond Flower, l'a donné à la Royal Shakespeare Company.

""Il y a toujours eu des questions sur le tableau"", a déclaré David Howells, conservateur de la Royal Shakespeare Company. ""Maintenant que nous connaissons la vérité, nous pouvons placer l'image à sa juste place dans l'histoire de la portraiture shakespearienne.""

Deux autres images de Shakespeare font également l'objet d'une étude dans le cadre de l'enquête, et les résultats seront annoncés plus tard ce mois-ci.

"Une vague coréenne déferle sur la Chine, de nombreuses Chinoises vénérant les acteurs sud-coréens Kim Soo Hyun et Lee Min Ho comme des demi-dieux. Les internautes chinois ont toujours été divisés sur les séries télévisées sud-coréennes, mais il ne fait aucun doute que les programmes du pays voisin connaissent actuellement une nouvelle vague de popularité en Chine. Et une grande partie du mérite en revient à You Who Came From The Star, la série télévisée sud-coréenne actuellement diffusée.
Les acteurs sud-coréens de premier plan Jun Ji-hyun et Kim Soo Hyun ont récemment obtenu un taux de popularité de 24,8 % dans leur pays, considéré comme élevé par Nielsen Korea. You Who Came From The Star et The Heirs ont fait l’objet de discussions animées en ligne dans toute l’Asie. De plus, le livre, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, lu par le héros dans You Who Came From The Star a été un article difficile à trouver sur Amazon pendant un certain temps.
Les deux programmes télévisés présentent plusieurs éléments communs : un héros grand, beau et riche qui aime la héroïne aveuglément et la protège toujours, et un homme tout aussi beau follement amoureux de la même femme. Les deux programmes dépeignent la pureté de l’amour, qui s’exprime à travers un baiser ou une étreinte chaleureuse. C’est peut-être le secret de leur succès ; peut-être que les gens sont toujours fascinés par les histoires de Cendrillon.
L’écart de richesse croissant est un sujet de préoccupation sociale en Corée du Sud et en Chine, et les défis auxquels sont confrontés les jeunes dans leur quête d’une vie meilleure ont peut-être poussé de nombreuses filles ordinaires à rêver de se marier à des hommes riches et attentionnés. C’est précisément ce que dépeignent les séries télévisées sud-coréennes populaires. En fait, les séries télévisées sud-coréennes sont conçues pour répondre aux exigences du marché.
En revanche, les écrans de télévision chinois sont inondés de feuilletons copiés ou mal faits. Il y a trop de séries télévisées chinoises qui sont soit de type guerre stéréotypé, soit qui copient aveuglément des programmes étrangers. Le manque de bonnes histoires a donné lieu à des tonnes de séries télévisées sur les voyages dans le temps ou les combats dans les harems des empereurs de la dynastie Qing. En bref, ce sont les maux des productions télévisées chinoises.
Le tournage des productions sud-coréennes commence généralement lorsque les scénarios ne sont prêts qu’à un tiers. De nombreuses productions populaires ont leurs propres sites Web, où les scénaristes publient une partie des scénarios terminés, invitant les téléspectateurs à laisser des messages, à discuter de l’intrigue et à proposer des suggestions pour les événements futurs. Cela permet non seulement de maintenir l’intérêt des téléspectateurs pour les séries télévisées, mais aussi d’aider les scénaristes et les réalisateurs à apporter des modifications aux scénarios pour répondre à la demande du public.
Espérons que le succès induit par l’innovation des programmes télévisés sud-coréens incitera les fabricants de séries télévisées chinoises à imaginer de nouvelles idées et à abandonner leur mauvaise pratique de copier les productions étrangères afin d’attirer davantage de téléspectateurs au pays, et peut-être à l’étranger.

"Le sport et l'école sont fatigants. Mais il y a un excellent moyen de se détendre après toutes ces activités. Allez au nord de Londres, dans le quartier le plus cool de la ville - Camden. Vous y trouverez des tendances de la mode et des célébrités.

Sam et moi avons marché le long de Camden High Street et nous nous sommes dirigés vers un pont au-dessus du canal Regent's. C'est une rivière artificielle de 9 miles qui traverse Londres.

Nous sommes entrés dans un grand marché et avons vu des enseignes folles, des t-shirts amusants et des choses comme des boucles d'oreilles faites à la main en vente. Nous avons acheté des nouilles chinoises frites. Elles avaient un goût très différent des nouilles que nous faisons à la maison, et nous les avons mangées à la fourchette au lieu de baguettes !

Camden est célèbre pour le style punk qui a commencé dans les années 1970. Les punks se promenaient avec des cheveux rose vif et verts, des vêtements déchirés avec des épingles de sûreté, des boutons métalliques et des oreilles et des lèvres percées. Les magasins de musique punk jouaient de la musique rock lourde et forte.

Mais il y avait aussi des groupes de hippies avec de gros pulls. Ils étaient assis dans des cafés en buvant du lait de soja, avec des vêtements noirs, du rouge à lèvres noir et des visages peints en blanc.

En plus de toutes ces personnes ""normales"", de nombreuses célébrités viennent à Camden. L'acteur Orlando Bloom de Pirates des Caraïbes y vit.

Camden est surtout connu comme un lieu de résidence pour les musiciens célèbres. De nombreux groupes de premier plan ont joué ici, dont Coldplay, Oasis - et le groupe préféré de Sam, The Vaccines. Je ne les avais jamais entendus auparavant - mais heureusement, ils jouaient ce soir-là à Camden.

"Les Américains et les Britanniques utilisent des salutations différentes. Aux États-Unis, la salutation la plus courante est ""Hi"". En Grande-Bretagne, c'est ""Hello!"" ou ""How are you?"". ""Hi!"" s'infiltre également dans l'anglais britannique. Lorsqu'ils sont présentés à quelqu'un, les Américains disent ""Glad to know you"". Les Britanniques disent ""How do you do?"" ou ""Pleased to meet you"". Lorsque les Américains disent ""Goodbye"", ils ajoutent presque toujours ""Have a good day"", ou ""Have a good trip"", etc. à leurs amis et à des inconnus. Les Britanniques commencent déjà à utiliser ""Have a good day"".

Les Britanniques utilisent généralement ""got"" au sens de ""have"". Les Américains le font rarement.
Am.E: Do you have a car, room, etc.? Yes, I do.
Br.E: Have you got a car, room, etc.? Yes, I have.

Enfin, il existe un certain nombre de différences entre l'anglais américain et l'anglais britannique dans l'orthographe des mots, par exemple check(US)/cheque(UK) ; center(US)/centre(UK). De nombreux mots américains se terminant par ""or"", par exemple honor, vigor, labor, sont orthographiés en anglais britannique avec un ""our"", par exemple honour, vigour, labour. De nombreux verbes en anglais américain avec des formes ""ize"" ou ""izing"", par exemple organize, realizing, sont orthographiés en anglais britannique ""ise"" ou ""ising"", par exemple organise, realising. En anglais américain, ""practice"" est utilisé à la fois pour le verbe et le nom. En anglais britannique, le verbe s'écrit ""practise"", et le nom ""practice"". En général, l'anglais américain évite la duplication des consonnes dans les noms et les verbes, tandis que l'anglais britannique ne le fait pas. En anglais américain, par exemple, on écrit ""travel, traveled, traveling, traveler"", tandis qu'en anglais britannique, on écrit ""travel, travelled, travelling, traveller"".

On avait autrefois prédit que l'anglais britannique et l'anglais américain finiraient par devenir des langues distinctes. Mais le contraire s'est produit. Les liens entre les deux pays sont si forts que linguistiquement, et probablement culturellement aussi, ils sont plus proches que jamais.
